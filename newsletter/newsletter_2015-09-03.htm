<p><strong>Liam's Map </strong> leads a field of eight horses for the $600,000 Woodward this Saturday at Saratoga Race Course. The 6-5 favorite, is one of four starters in the race from trainer Todd Pletcher's barn. The 4-year-old colt is coming off a giant effort in the Whitney on August 8 at Saratoga, in which he set a terrific pace and nearly took the star-studded field from start-to-finish before being picked up by Honor Code in the final jumps. Ridden by Javier Castellano from post position 2, Liam's Map had won four consecutive races coming into the Whitney.</p>

<p>The 1 1/8 mile Woodward, for 3-year-olds and up in the Breeders' Cup Classic division, is the sixth of 10 telecasts under the "Breeders' Cup Challenge Series" banner of automatic qualifying races leading into the Breeders' Cup World Championships, Oct. 30-31, from Keeneland Race Course. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-saratoga-race-course-woodward-stakes.html">Learn More &gt;&gt;</a> </p>
