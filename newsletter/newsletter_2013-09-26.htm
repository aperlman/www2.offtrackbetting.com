Last time out was terrific win over Fort Larned in the Grade 1 Whitney Invitational after a great second behind Sahara Sky in the Grade 1 Metropolitan Handicap May 27 at Belmont Park and a successful graded stakes debut - a good second behind Flat Out in the Grade 3 Westchester Stakes at Belmont Park April 27 with a Beyer Speed Figure over 115. He may not be the most experienced of the contenders but he has looked terrific in his short career! Cross Traffic has gone up against the best and prospered - no reason to think differently about this weekend. He departs from the far outside post as the 5-2 favorite and will have John Velazquez in the saddle. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-jockey-club-gold-cup-invitational.html">Read More</a></p>

Taylor Stakes at Woodbine in October 2011. 2012 was better for Laughing - two wins and a second place finish in six starts - the best result being a win in the Grade 3 Matchmaker Stakes at Monmouth Park in July. Laughing has been terrific in 2013 defeating the likes of Stephanie's Kitten, Dayatthespa, Ruthenia, Pianist and Dream Peace - three starts and three wins. Last time out was in the Grade 2 Ballston Spa after the Grade 1 Diana Stakes over Center Court and before that was in the Grade 3 Eatontown at Monmouth Park June 29. She will look to stretch the impressive winning streak to four as the 123 pound highweight from post 7 with Jose Lezcano in the saddle. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-flower-bowl-invitational.html">Read More</a></p>

Lauderdale Stakes at Gulfstream January 12 and followed that with two straight Allowance Optional Claiming scores - the last coming at Churchill Downs May 2. He had a nice second in the Grade 2 Monmouth Stakes behind Boisterous June 9 before his best career result - a win in the Grade 1 United Nations Stakes at Monmouth Park July 6. Last time out he continued to shine with a win in the Grade 1 Sword Dancer at Saratoga August 17. He has 10 wins, two seconds and four third place finishes in 17 career starts, has placed in all six 2013 races and has to be on the radar for the Joe Hirsch. He will be out for revenge against Boisterous this week and certainly has the motivation and form to provide a good run this weekend. He will be looking for his third straight Grade 1 score, is 8-5 on the morning line and is coupled along with... <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-joe-hirsch-turf-classic.html">Read More</a></p>

Sandwiched in there is a third place finish in an Allowance at Belmont Park last September 15. He returns to the track after nearly six months away but there is no denying the talent of this impressive colt. He has two wins and a third place finish in three starts at this distance, is the 120 pound highweight and will have Edgar Prado in the saddle from post 2 as the likely favorite. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-kelso-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>

He looked good in the spring in a pair of races at Oaklawn Park posting wins in an Allowance Optional Claiming and the Grade 3 Count Fleet Sprint Handicap over the scorching Gentlemen's Bet. He followed that with a good second in the Grade 2 True North Handicap at Belmont Park in June and finished fourth in the Grade 2 Smile Sprint Handicap at Calder behind Trinniberg. Last time out was an Ok third in the Grade 1 Forego behind Strapping Groom August 31 after a career best performance - a great win in the Grade 1 Vanderbilt Handicap at Saratoga August 4.
