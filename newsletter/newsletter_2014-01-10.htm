					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-santa-anita-park-san-pasqual-stakes.html">San Pasqual Stakes</a> at Santa Anita Park (Grade 2)</b>: <strong><em>Blueskiesnrainbows</em></strong>  - Jerry Hollendorfer pupil won the 2012 Grade 1 Swaps Stakes but struggled a bit after that - an OK fourth in the Grade 2 Mervyn Leroy as 2-1 favorite at Hollywood Park May 4 2013 followed a nice Allowance Optional Claiming score by 3 3/4 lengths March 22 and a pair of seconds in Allowance Optional Claiming to start his 2013 campaign. Also last year he had a third in the Grade 3 Cougar II Handicap July 26, a twelfth in the Grade 1 Pacific Classic August 25, a win in the minor but competitive Ralph M. Hinds September 22 at Barretts Race Meet At Fairplex and a fifth in the minor Bull Dog Handicap at Fresno October 13. Last time out was a terrific gate-to-wire win in the Grade 3 Native Diver at Hollywood Park December 14 after a good second behind London Bridge in the Breeders' Cup Marathon. He looks to be rounding back into form with two wins, a second and a third in his last six starts overall. Blueskiesnrainbows has six wins in 22 career starts and is the hottest of the entries for this race. Martin Pedroza gets the call from post 2.  <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-santa-anita-park-san-pasqual-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-santa-anita-park-sham-stakes.html">Sham Stakes</a> at Santa Anita Park (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em>Top Fortitude</em></strong> - has just one career start for trainer R. Kory Owens and it was a good one - a MSW score at Hollywood Park November 16. He had a field best 92 Beyer Speed Figure in that race and is expected to bring the speed in his first start around two turns. Up and coming Kayla Stra will be in the saddle from post 5.</p>

<p><em><strong>Life Is a Joy</strong></em> - Jerry Hollendorfer trained gelding races in graded stakes company for the first time off a second in the minor King Glorious Stakes at Hollywood Park December 22 and an eighth in the minor Real Quiet Stakes November 23. He won his first three career starts including the Charlie Palmer Stakes at Fresno in his third start October 5. He enters as the top money earner in the field and is one of the most experienced as well.

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-hals-hope-stakes.html">Hal's Hope Stakes</a> at Gulfstream Park (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em>Csaba</em></strong> - is the defending champion in this race. He enters having won two and finished second in the other two of his last four starts - the biggest of the wins coming in the Grade 3 Fred W. Hooper Handicap at Calder December 7 and the best of the seconds coming last time out in the minor Harlan's Holiday Stakes on this track December 22. Csaba was at his best at this time last year when he won five of six starts - he looks close to getting back to that form as the new year starts. He is also entered in the Ft. Lauderdale but will likely choose the Hal's Hope. Csaba is the 121 pound highweight and leaves from post 2 with Paco Lopez in the saddle.

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-fort-lauderdale-stakes.html">Fort Lauderdale Stakes</a> at Gulfstream Park (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em> Summer Front </em></strong>- Christophe Clement trainee finished a good second to Silentio last time out in the Grade 2 Citation Handicap at Hollywood Park November 29 but had a disappointing seventh in the Grade 1 Shadwell Turf Mile October 5 after two terrific graded stakes wins - in the Grade 3 Matchmaker at Monmouth Park August 25 and in the Grade 3 Miami Mile at Calder in April. He ended 2012 with a sixth in the Grade 1 Hollywood Derby after a pair of thirds in Grade 1 races - the Jamaica and the Secretariat Stakes. He also had a win in the Grade 3 Hill Prince over Howe Great and the minor Duluth Stakes in 2012. Summer Front has two wins and a second in his last four graded stakes starts with a seventh sandwiched in there. Joe Bravo gets the mount on the 121 pound highweight from post 6.
