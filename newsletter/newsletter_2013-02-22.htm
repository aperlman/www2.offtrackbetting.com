<p>At OffTrackBetting.com, we believe we've raised the bar to a new height when it comes to <strong>Player Rewards</strong>. We looked at some of our competitors reward programs and were confused - so many rules, exceptions and minimum thresholds to meet.</p> 
<p>Deciding which online Racebook gives you the greatest betting advantage comes down to simple arithmetic. For every $1,000 wagered, you can <strong>earn  cash rewards up to $120</strong> at OTB. That same $1,000 at another ADW  would get you at best $30, and that is only if you bet on specific "bonus tracks." <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse-racing-rewards.html"><strong>See Player Rewards Comparison</strong></a></p>

					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-gulfstream-park-fountain-of-youth-stakes.html">Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park</a></b>: (<strong>Grade 2</strong>): <strong>Violence</strong> - Todd Pletcher trained colt has three wins in three career starts including the Grade 2 Nashua Stakes by two lengths over Vegas No Show at Aqueduct November 4 and a Maiden Special Weight score in his debut at Saratoga August 18. Last time out was another impressive score in the Grade 1 CashCall Futurity at Hollywood Park December 15. He has an incredible pedigree is very versatile and is your morning line favorite to run away with the 50 points Saturday.</p> 
					<p> <strong>He's Had Enough</strong> - Doug O'Neill trained colt has six career starts with a win in his debut and a very nice second place finish three back in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile behind Shanghai Bobby - by a head. Last time out was a good third in the Grade 2 Robert B. Lewis Stakes at Santa Anita February 2 after a disappointing fifth in the Grade 1 CashCall Futurity December 15 at Hollywood Park against a very competitive field. He's Had Enough needs to ramp it up and will be looking for his first stakes win in the Fountain of Youth this week - 50 points is on the line.  <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-gulfstream-park-fountain-of-youth-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-gulfstream-park-davona-dale-stakes.html">Davona Dale Stakes at Gulfstream Park</a>  (Grade 2)</b>: <strong>Dreaming of Julia</strong> - Todd Pletcher filly entered the Breeders' Cup in November having started three career races and winning all - a win on August 6 by an astounding 10 1/2 lengths at Saratoga was followed by an equally impressive 16 1/4 length score in the Meadow Star Classic on September 9. She was impressive in winning the Grade 1 Frizette Stakes at Belmont October 6 before an OK third last time out in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies - her only career blemish. She makes her seasonal debut Saturday hoping to erase memory of her worst career result - that decent third last time out.</p> 
					<p><strong>Lady Banks</strong> - is a stakes winner - the Ruthless Stakes last time out at Aqueduct January 12 followed a MSW score on that same track December 14. She debuted in November - a second in a MSW at Aqueduct. As the only other stakes place entry in the field, Lady Banks, on paper should be the one to give Dreaming of Julia a run. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-gulfstream-park-davona-dale-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-san-carlos-stakes.html">San Carlos Stakes at Santa Anita Park</a> (Grade 2)</b>:  <strong>The Lumber Guy</strong> - one of the leading sprinters in the nation Lumber Guy has eight career starts with four wins - the Grade 1 Vosburgh at Belmont Park September 29, the Grade 2 Jerome Stakes on April 21, the Miracle Wood Stakes on February 25 and a Maiden Special Weight race in January 2012. His only losses include a fifth in the Grade 1 Wood Memorial on April 7, a disappointing sixth in the Grade 2 Peter Pan on May 12 ,a close second to Trinniberg in the Breeders' Cup Sprint and last time out in his worst career performance ever - a seventh in the Grade 1 Malibu Stakes as favorite here December 26. He was up and down last year but may be due in the San Carlos if he is over the foot injury that has plagued him recently.</p>
					<p><strong>Sahara Sky</strong> - Jerry Hollendorfer trained Sahara Sky raced in graded stakes company for the first time last time out having won twice, finished second twice and recorded a third place finish in five Allowance races in 2012. He had been out of action since June 22 when he was third in an Allowance at Hollywood Park before his most recent start - an impressive and unexpected win in the Grade 2 Palos Verdes on this track January 19 at 21-1 odds. He is on the radar now and should contend in the San Carlos. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-san-carlos-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
