<p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0px; clear:both; padding-top:15px;"><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/">The Championship Meet at Gulfstream Park</a> </b></p>

<p><strong>Opening Day will feature the $1.1 million Claiming Crown, nine races drawing full fields and horses from throughout North America. </strong> - The 77th season of championship racing begins at Gulfstream Park featuring a record 73 stakes and $11.61 million in purses. Champion jockey Javier Castellano will attempt to win his fifth consecutive riding title, trainer Todd Pletcher will attempt to win an unprecedented 13th consecutive training title, and many of the country's top classic contenders and turf stars will race through April.</p>

<p>Castellano will be joined by many of the country's top riders including John Velazquez, Julien Leparoux, Irad Ortiz Jr., Paco Lopez. Joel Rosario, Jose Lezcano and Edgar Prado. Pletcher will be challenged for another title by Bill Mott, Chad Brown, Kiaran McLaughlin, Graham Motion, Eddie Plesa Jr., Nick Zito, Shug McGaughey and Christophe Clement.</p>

<p> Scheduled to be hosted by Gulfstream Park for the fourth consecutive year, the $1.1 million Claiming Crown received 309 nominations for the nine-race event that will highlight the opening-day program for the 2015-2016 Championship Meet Dec. 5. The centerpiece of the event, the $200,000 Jewel, was created in 1999 to honor the blue-collar horses that are the foundation of the racing industry nationwide.

The Jewel, a 1 1/8-mile race for 3-year-olds and up that have raced for a claiming price of $35,000 or lower, attracted 32 nominations, including the Pletcher-trained African Fighter and Village Warrior, Hollendorfer-trained Perfect Set and Prime Issue, and the Maker-trained Flashlight, Lieutenant Seany O and Private Tale.</p>
