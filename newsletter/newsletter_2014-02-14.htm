					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-golden-gate-fields-el-camino-real-derby.html">El Camino Real Derby G3</a> at Golden Gate Fields, Saturday, February 15</b>: <strong><em> Tamarando </em></strong>- Jerry Hollendorfer trained colt had three MSW starts to start his career and finally broke maiden at Del Mar August 18 after a second in his second start and a fourth in his debut. He went on to win two of four starts - the Grade 1 Del Mar Futurity at 7-1 odds over Dance with Fate September 4 and the 1 1/16 mile, $100,000 Real Quite Stakes by 3 1/4 lengths over Electric Eddie and Karma King November 23. He also had a pair of thirds sandwiched in there - the Grade 1 FrontRunner Stakes at Santa Anita in September in his first try around two turns and the minor Golden State Juvenile. Last time out was an OK second in the minor California Cup Derby behind the terrific California Chrome at Santa Anita January 25 after a respectable third in the Grade 1 CashCall Futurity at Hollywood Park December 14. Hall of Fame rider Russell Baze gets the call from gate 4 Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-golden-gate-fields-el-camino-real-derby.html">Read More</a></p>					
				
					
<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-mac-diarmida-stakes.html">Mac Diarmida Stakes G2</a> at Gulfstream Park, Saturday, February 15</b>: <strong><em>Twilight Eclipse</em></strong>- is the world record holder at 1 1/2 miles on turf coming off a terrific win in the Grade 2 William McKnight Handicap at 12 furlongs last time out December 28 - a race he won in wire-to-wire fashion by seven lengths. He was fourth in this race last year before he won in the Grade 2 Pan American Stakes at Gulfstream in that world record time March 23 but he followed that with a fifth in the Grade 1 Manhattan Handicap at Belmont Park June 8. He then raced to a pair of seconds in the Grade 1 Man o' War Stakes behind Boisterous at Belmont Park July 13 and in the Grade 1 Sword Dancer behind Big Blue Kitten. He had a fifth in the Grade 1 Joe Hirsch Turf at Belmont Park September 28 and followed that with a fifth in the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic and a sixth in the Breeders' Cup Turf as well. Twilight Eclipse has been a bit up and down but a win last time out has a lot of people believing again. Jose Lezcano has the call from gate 6.

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-laurel-park-barbara-fritchie-handicap.html">Barbara Fritchie Handicap G2</a> at Laurel Park</b>: <strong><em> Winning Image</em></strong> - Michael Aro pupil won four straight minor stakes races late 2012/early 2013 - the Sweet and Sassy Stakes and the Dashing Beauty at Delaware Park, the My Juliet Stakes at Parx and the Willa On the Move Stakes at Laurel Park back in December. She followed that with a ninth in the Grade 2 Presque Isle Downs Masters September 9 and was fourth in the minor Cornucopia Stakes at Parx in October. Winning Image returned to the winner's circle last time out however - in the minor What a Summer Stakes on this track January 25. She has 12 career wins and looks like the one to beat Saturday. Tony Black will be in the saddle from post 6.

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-santa-anita-park-santa-maria-stakes.html">Santa Maria Stakes G2</a> at Santa Anita Park </b>: <strong><em>  Fiftyshadesofhay </em></strong> - Bob Baffert trained filly has 14 career starts. She had a very nice second behind Beholder in the Grade 1 Las Virgenes Stakes March 2 and she won the Grade 3 Santa Ysabel by 5 3/4 lengths last January 26 on this track in her graded stakes debut with an impressive Beyer speed figure of 90. She was third in the Grade 1 Santa Anita Oaks April 6 also behind Beholder and had a nice two race win streak last year - the Grade 2 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes at Pimlico May 17 and in the Grade 3 Iowa Oaks June 29 and has looked good in four starts since as well. Last time out was a somewhat disappointing fourth in the Grade 2 La Canada Stakes here January 19 after a second as even-money favorite in the Grade 2 Bayakoa at Hollywood Park December 7, a third in the Grade 2 Indiana Oaks and a second behind Princess of Sylmar in the Grade 1 Alabama Stakes in August. She has four wins, four seconds and three third place finishes in her career and will be looking to bounce back for the first time she hasn't placed in her last eight starts. Martin Garcia will be in the saddle from the 2 hole Saturday.
