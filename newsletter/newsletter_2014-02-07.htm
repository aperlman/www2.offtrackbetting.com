					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-donn-handicap.html">Donn Handicap (G1)</a> at Gulfstream Park, Sunday, February 9</b>: <strong><em> Will Take Charge </em></strong>- 2013 Eclipse Award winner for three year old colt was one of the only colts to race all three legs of the Triple Crown finishing eighth in the Kentucky Derby, seventh in the Preakness and tenth in the Belmont. This after an impressive win in the Grade 2 Rebel at Oaklawn Park in March. A lot was expected of this colt in the Triple Crown for trainer D. Wayne Lukas but he had fallen flat on the biggest stages... before a two race win streak after the Triple Crown - in the Grade 2 Pennsylvania Derby at Parx September 21 and a tremendous win in the Grade 1 Travers at Saratoga August 24 after a good second ahead of Moreno and behind Palace Malice in the Grade 2 Jim Dandy Stakes July 27. Last time out was yet another win in the Grade 1 Clark at Churchill Downs November 29 after a good yet disappointing second in the Breeders' Cup Classic. His last six months have been absolutely remarkable and as the 123 pound highweight he is clearly the one to beat. Luis Saez gets the call form post 2 Sunday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-donn-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>					
				
					
<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-suwannee-river-stakes.html">Suwannee River Stakes (G3)</a> at Gulfstream Park, Saturday, February 8</b>: <strong><em>Riposte  </em></strong>- British bred filly makes her North American debut Saturday after six starts in Europe yielded two wins and a second place finish. Her biggest score to date came in the Grade 2 Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot, winning convincingly by 2 1/4 lengths which proves her class. Riposte's last three starts haven't been great however - a pair of fifths this summer were followed by a seventh last time out in the Grade 2 Qatar Prix de Royallieu at Longchamp October 5. Despite her lack of recent success, Riposte looks like the one to beat Saturday. Joel Rosario gets the call from the rail for this much anticipated North American debut.

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-santa-anita-park-robert-b-lewis-stakes.html">Robert B. Lewis Stakes (G2)</a> at Santa Anita Park</b>: <strong><em> Midnight Hawk</em></strong> - Bob Baffert trained colt has been very impressive in his career thus far - two wins in two career starts. Last time out was by 1 3/4 lengths as 2-5 favorite in the Grade 3 Sham Stakes here January 11 after a MSW score in his debut at Hollywood Park January 13. His early results have him looking like a contender for both the Santa Anita and Kentucky Derbies. Midnight Hawk is unquestionably the one to beat Saturday and Mike Smith has the call.

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-santa-anita-park-san-antonio-stakes.html">San Antonio Stakes (G2)</a> at Santa Anita Park (Grade 2)</b>: <strong><em>  Game on Dude </em></strong> - Bob Baffert trained gelding is a multiple Grade 1 winner and is the defending champion in this race. He had nine graded stakes scores in his last 13 starts - five straight last year including the Grade 2 Charles Town Classic over Clubhouse Ride back in April, the Grade 1 Hollywood Gold Cup and in July, the Grade 1 Pacific Classic at Del Mar August 25 in the second fastest time recorded in that race in the last 10 years. He enters on a two race losing streak - a second last time out to Will Take Charge in the Grade 1 Clark Handicap at Churchill Downs November 29 followed a very disappointing ninth as 8-5 favorite in the Breeders' Cup Classic. He was the most impressive horse on the planet last year and will be looking to gain her first win in over five months Saturday.
