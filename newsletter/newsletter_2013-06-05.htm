			<p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0px; clear:both; padding-top:15px;"><b>GRADED STAKES RACE PREVIEWS & RACE FAVORITES </b></p>
					
					
				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-brooklyn-handicap.html">Brooklyn Handicap 2013 at Belmont Park</a> (Grade 2):  Calidoscopio</b> - Argentinean entry recorded a terrific upset win in the Breeders' Cup Marathon in November after five months off and a win in the Group 2 General Belgrano in Argentina. Before that was a ninth in a Group 1 race in his native land and a win in February also in Argentina. He won two huge races in a row despite long layoffs - but is coming off a rather disappointing fifth as 5-2 favorite in the Grade 3 Tokyo City Cup Stakes at Santa Anita March 23. A lot is expected of this Mike Pyupe trained entry and so is a bounce back from a rather poor outing in the Tokyo City. A 10-year-old son of Luhuk, Calidoscopio will carry high weight of 122 pounds in the Brooklyn. </p>
					
					<p><strong>Ruler On Ice</strong> - won the 2011 Belmont Stakes and was the third in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs that year to go along with numerous seconds and thirds at multiple graded stakes events. In 2012 Ruler on Ice started four races with disappointing results - a eighth in the Grade 1 Donn Handicap, a seventh in an Allowance Optional Claiming, a second in a similar race at Delaware Park on August 25 and a distant tenth in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park in September. After four months away he returned January 30 to a win in an Allowance Optional Claiming and went on to a fifth in the Grade 3 Excelsior and a fourth in an Allowance at Parx in April. Last time out was an OK second in the minor Majestic Light Stakes at Monmouth Park May 25. He will be looking for his first stakes win since the 2011 Belmont Stakes and enters in so-so form. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-brooklyn-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
				
				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-belmont-stakes.html">145th Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park</a> (Grade 1)</b>:  <strong>Orb</strong> - appears prime for a bounce back effort this week after an OK Preakness in which he got lost in the shuffle and fell victim to almost a perfect trip by Oxbow. He still holds victories in the Kentucky Derby by 2 1/4 lengths, the Grade 1 Florida Derby March 30 at Gulfstream, the Grade 2 Fountain of Youth Stakes February 23 and an Allowance Optional Claiming score January 26 - his only blemish was the Preakness. With Shug McGaughey training him and Joel Rosario riding Orb, he is still the morning line favorite to bounce back and reclaim his status as the best three year old in the land. </p>
					
					<p><strong>Revolutionary</strong> - Todd Pletcher trained colt entered the Kentucky Derby on a three race win streak - a terrific score in the Grade 2 Louisiana Derby March 30, a win in the Grade 3 Withers Stakes at Aqueduct February 2 and an 8 1/2 length win over Transparent at Aqueduct December 28 over 1 mile. He put up a fight in the Derby and finished an OK third and skipped the Preakness. He is the second choice on the morning line and starts from post 7 right beside Oxbow and two over from Orb who he should be neck-and-neck with throughout. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-belmont-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-manhattan-handicap.html">Manhattan Handicap 2013 at Belmont Park</a></b><strong> (Grade 1): Point of Entry</strong> - is one of the premier grass horses in the nation and had won five straight races with relative ease heading into the Breeders' Cup Turf where he finished second to Little Mike. The wins include the Grade 1 Joe Hirsch Turf Classic in September, the Grade 1 Sword Dancer in August, the Grade 1 Man o`War Stakes on July 14 and the Grade 2 Elkhorn on April 27. Last time out he rebounded from his second in the Breeders' Cup with another typically easy win in the Grade 1 Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap February 9 over Animal Kingdom in his only start of 2013. He is the overwhelming favorite at 3-5 odds for the Manhattan and trainer Shug McGaughey feels Point of Entry is poised for a huge race.</p> 
					<p><strong>Optimizer</strong> - finished eleventh in last year's Kentucky Derby, sixth in the Preakness and tenth in the Belmont Stakes and finished the fourth in the Grade 2 Virginia Derby after that. He won the Grade 3 Kent Stakes at Delaware Park and an Allowance Optional Claiming and went on to a disappointing eleventh in the Breeders' Cup. In 2013 he won the Grade 2 Colonel E.R. Bradley Handicap and the Grade 3 Fair Grounds Handicap February 23 to start his year and stumbled a tad after that. He rebounded with a second in the Woodford Reserve Turf Classic at Churchill Downs May 4 - beaten by only reigning Horse of the Year Wise Dan and followed that with a third last time out in the Grade 2 Dixie Stakes at Pimlico May 18. Optimizer is a multiple graded stakes winner on grass, has been in some huge races with mixed results and enters the Manhattan in so-so form. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-manhattan-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
