She enters having not finished worse than second in her last 12 starts with 10 - yes 10 wins over that span.

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-woobine-racetrack-northern-dancer-turf-stakes.html"> Grade 1 Northern Dancer Turf Stakes at Woodbine</a></strong> - The Northern Dancer Turf Stakes is named after Northern Dancer, the first Canadian-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. Following a commendable performance in the Grade 1 Arlington Million, <strong>Danish Dynaformer 6-1</strong> will be back on his home course on the Woodbine Mile undercard in Saturday's Grade 1, $300,000 Northern Dancer Turf. Danish Dynaformer saved ground at the back of the pack in the Aug. 13 Arlington Million before mounting a late charge to finish a close fifth, beaten 1-1/2 lengths.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-belmont-park-sands-point-stakes.html"> Grade 2 Sands Point Stakes at Belmont Park</a></strong> - Seven sophomore females will take to the track in the Sands Point Stakes - race 9 on Belmont Park's Saturday schedule. Stuart Janney III's homebred <strong>On Leave 5-2</strong> will look to extend her win streak to four when she makes her graded stakes debut this weekend. The gray daughter of War Front broke her maiden by two lengths in her sophomore debut at Belmont in June and returned to post a three-quarter-length victory against optional claimers the following month. On Leave was untouchable this past summer and hopes to keep the roll going in her graded stakes bow. Jose Ortiz rides the morning line favorite from post 5.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-presque-isle-downs-masters-stakes.html"> Grade 3 Presque Isle Downs Masters Stakes Preview</a></strong> - <strong>Living The Life 4-1</strong> - defending two-time champion in this race - Irish bred synthetic specialist filly has 34 career starts with 10 wins (six stakes), five seconds and four third place finishes for trainer Gary Mandella and enters off a disappointing seventh in the minor Southern Truce Stakes at Santa Anita July 3. Living the Life has been a tad difficult to figure out but has placed in three of her last five starts overall. Flavien Prat will be in the saddle of the tepid morning line favorite from gate 6 in what is her absolute favorite race.</p>
