                    <span>At OffTrackBetting.com, we believe we've raised the bar to a new height when it comes to player rewards. All members are automatically enrolled to receive Daily Rebates based on the previous days activity that earns you cash back on every wager you make, win or lose. Other websites only offer this type of program to select high-volume horseplayers, but we make this available to everybody - everyday.<br>
                    <br>
                    Your account gives you  rebates on wagers from nearly every track we offer - up to 12%. Other websites offer one-time signup bonuses and Reward Point Systems, but these offers require a substantial effort to redeem -- you have to wager up to 5x the bonus offer at some sites.<br>
                    <br>
                    For a list of the current rebates available to you please <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/rebates.html">click here</a>.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is easy to see that using your OffTrackBetting.com account will give you more value back than any of the other offers you may find because the Daily Rebate program is in effect every day you play. </span>
