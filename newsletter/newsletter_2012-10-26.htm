					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-keeneland-fayette-stakes.html">FAYETTE STAKES</a> at Keeneland (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em>Take Charge Indy</em></strong> - results include G1-Florida Derby (1st); G1-Breeders' Cup Juvenile (5th); G1-Breeders' Futurity (4th); G3-Arlington-Washington Futurity (2nd). He has been out of action since a disappointing nineteenth place finish in the Kentucky Derby but a win in the Florida Derby in March has him on the Fayette Stakes radar for sure.</p> 
					<p><em><strong>Newsdad </strong></em>- is the course record holder here over 1 1/4 miles. He had an impressive victory over Simmard at the Grade 2 Pan American Stakes at Gulfstream in March for his best result this year but has struggled since - a fifth in the Grade 1 Elkhorn in April, a fourth in the Grade 1 Man o' War Stakes in July, a fourth in the Grade 1 Sword Dancer and a fifth last time out in the Grade 2 Bowling Green are all that Newsdad has mustered in four starts since his impressive win in the Pan American. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-keeneland-fayette-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-santa-anita-autumn-miss-stakes.html">AUTUMN MISS STAKES</a> at Santa Anita (Grade 3)</b>:  <strong><em>Lady Ten</em></strong> - Bob Baffert trained filly has placed in all 10 career starts with three wins, five seconds and two third place finishes. She has yet to start a graded stakes race but she won the minor Sandy Blue Handicap two back and was second last time out in the Swingtime Stakes.</p>
					<p><strong><em>Charm the Maker</em></strong> - Finished fourth in the Grade 3 Santa Ysabel and finished second in the Grade 1 Hollywood Starlet to end 2011. Her last three starts have been OK - an eight in the Grade 1 Las Virgines March 3 was followed by a fourth in the Grade 3 Providencia and a decent second behind Byrama last time out in the minor Unzip Me Stakes here September 29. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-santa-anita-autumn-miss-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

Last time out was a good second to The Lumber Guy in the Grade 1 Vosburgh at here September 29. Caixa Electronica is hot and cold but gets a reprieve from Grade 1 competition in this Grade 3 event. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-belmont-park-bold-ruler-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>

She has raced only twice in 2012 but is the morning line favorite and rightfully so. </p> 
                    <p><strong><em>Afleeting Lady </em></strong>- Dale Romans trained Afleeting Lady finished 2011 off with a very good second in the Grade 2 Falls City Handicap at Churchill Downs but started 2012 with a disappointing fifth in the Grade 2 La Troienne. Since that result, she has won an Allowance Optional Claiming, finished a very good second in the Grade 2 Fleur de Lis Handicap and followed that with a disappointing sixth in the Grade 2 Molly Pitcher July 29. Last time out she rebounded with a win in the minor Lady's Secret Stakes September 3. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-belmont-park-turn-back-the-alarm-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
