					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-breeders-cup-classic-contenders.html">BREEDERS' CUP CLASSIC</a> at Santa Anita (Grade 1)</b>: <strong><em>Game on Dude</em></strong> - is a multiple Grade 1 winner that is in the thick of the Horse of the Year conversation. He rebounded very nicely from a disappointing twelfth in the Dubai World Cup with a terrific win in the Grade 2 Californian Stakes on June 2 over Kettle Corn and then followed it up with another impressive score in the Grade 1 Hollywood Gold Cup.</p> 
					<p><em><strong>Flat Out </strong></em>- won last year's Jockey Club Gold Cup and repeated that score last time out September 29. Prior to his win in the Jockey Club Gold Cup he was a very good second in the Grade 2 Monmouth Cup July 7 and an OK third two back in the Grade 1 Whitney Invitational Handicap August 4. He was last year's Breeders' Cup Classic favourite finished fifth in that race - he will be looking for some redemption Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-breeders-cup-classic-contenders.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-breeders-cup-ladies-classic-entries.html">BREEDERS' CUP LADIES CLASSIC</a> at Santa Anita (Grade 1)</b>:  <strong><em>Royal Delta </em></strong> - - has looked exceptional of late - two straight wins including the Grade 2 Delaware Handicap and the Grade 2 Fleur de Lis Handicap on June 16 at Churchill Downs were followed by a respectable second in the Grade 1 Personal Ensign Handicap at Saratoga on August 26.</p>
					<p><strong><em>Awesome Feather</em></strong> - Chad Brown filly has 10 career starts and 10 wins - not too shabby! She is a multiple graded stakes winner and the champion of the 2010 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. She won the Florida Sunshine Millions Distaff in January and then endured an eight month layoff before coming back September 20 to a win in the Nasty Storm Stakes. Awesome Feather has yet to taste defeat and will be looking to keep it that way this weekend. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-breeders-cup-ladies-classic-entries.html">Read More</a></p>

                    <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-breeders-cup-grey-goose-juvenile-fillies-entries.html">BREEDERS' CUP JUVENILE FILLIES</a> at Santa Anita (Grade 1)</b>: <strong><em>Executiveprivilege</em></strong> - Bob Baffert trained filly is undefeated in five career starts. She broke maiden with a four and a half length win in a five and a half furlong Maiden Special Weight race at Hollywood Park on June 28 and followed that result with an impressive three and a quarter length win in the Landaluce Stakes. </p>
					<p><strong><em>Dreaming of Julia</em></strong> - Todd Pletcher filly enters the Breeders' Cup having started three career races and winning all - a win on August 6 by an astounding ten and a half lengths at Saratoga was followed by an equally impressive 16 1/4 length score in the Meadow Star Classic on September 9. Last time out was yet another impressive score in the Grade 1 Frizette Stakes at Belmont October 6. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-breeders-cup-grey-goose-juvenile-fillies-entries.html">Read More</a></p>
					 				
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-breeders-cup-turf-contenders.html">BREEDERS' CUP TURF</a> at Santa Anita (Grade 1)</b>: <strong><em>Point of Entry</em></strong>  - is one of the premier grass horses in the nation and has won five straight races with relative ease heading into the Breeders' Cup - six of his last seven including the Grade 1 Joe Hirsch Turf Classic last time out, the Grade 1 Sword Dancer, the Grade 1 Man o`War Stakes on July 14 and the Grade 2 Elkhorn on April 27. Before that he won an Allowance at Keeneland March 12 and he finished fourth and first respectively in Allowance races at Gulfstream. Point of Entry is in terrific form and figures to be the favorite Saturday. </p> 
                    <p><strong><em>St. Nicholas Abbey </em></strong>- Graded stakes winner that won the Emirate Airline Breeders' Cup Turf in 2011. He also finished third in the Dubai Sheema Classic March 31 of this year. Needless to say St. Nicholas Abbey loves Dubai! He raced to two straight third place finishes before an eleventh last time out in a Group 1 Stakes in Ireland. He makes his North American debut Saturday but is not in the greatest form despite being named second choice for the Turf. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-breeders-cup-turf-contenders.html">Read More</a></p>
