Some of the best three year olds in the land will be after the winner's share of the very nice $1 million purse and the 100 qualifying points towards a start in the Kentucky Derby when they go 1 1/8 miles on Gulfstream's main track.</p> 
					<p><strong><em>
					  Cairo Prince </em></strong> - has four career starts for trainer Kiaran McLaughlin - three wins and a thrilling second to Honor Code in the Grade 2 Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct November 30. Last time out was his best career result - a dominating win 5 3/4 length with a 95 Beyer Speed Figure in the Grade 2 Holy Bull Stakes on this track January 25. He also won the Grade 2 Nashua River Stakes at Aqueduct November 3 and had a MSW score in his debut at Belmont Park. Cairo Prince is a head away from being undefeated and is the 9-5 morning line favorite Saturday as he leaves from post 3 with regular rider Luis Saez. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-florida-derby.html">Read More</a></p>
					<p><strong><em>Wildcat Red</em></strong> - has already made quite a name for himself on the Road to the Kentucky Derby. He has six career starts for trainer Jose Garoffalo and rides a very impressive win streak into the Florida Derby - a win last time out in the Grade 2 Fountain of Youth on this track February 22 followed a win in the Grade 3 Hutcheson Stakes ahead of C. Zee here February 1 and a pair of seconds in minor stakes action also on this track - behind General a Rod in the Gulfstream Park Derby January 1 and in the Juvenile Sprint Stakes November 9. He started his career with a pair of wins as well - an Allowance in October and a MSW in his career debut September 14. Wildcat Red has four wins and two seconds in six career starts and is one of the favorites to score the 100 points Saturday. He drew the rail and will have John Velazquez aboard at 3-1 odds.

					  <p><strong><em>Ruler Of The World </em></strong> - last year's Grade 1 Epsom Derby winner in England and Aidan O'Brien trainee has been installed as the favorite more because of the lack of class in the field rather than his dominating career - Saturday will mark his first start of 2014 and his first try on synthetic. He won his first three career starts including but hasn`t tasted victory since June - four starts since and a second and a third place finish to show for it. Last time out was an OK third in the Grade 1 Champion Stakes at Ascot. In a slightly underwhelming field, Ruler Of The World appears to be the best of the bunch although I am not convinced. He starts from post 12. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-meydan-racecourse-dubai-world-cup.html">Read More</a></p>

He is arguably the hottest of the entries for the World Cup and starts from gate 8 Saturday. He is fit as they come and is expected to be one of the ones to beat Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-meydan-racecourse-dubai-world-cup.html">Read More</a></p>
