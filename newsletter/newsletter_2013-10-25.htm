					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-bold-ruler-handicap.html">Bold Ruler Handicap at Belmont Park</a>  (Grade 3): </b><em><strong>Strapping Groom</strong></em> - raced in graded stakes company for the first time in July and finished fifth in the Grade 3 James Marvin here but followed that with a good win in the minor Kid Russell Stakes August 12 and his best ever result - a win in the Grade 1 Forego Stakes at Saratoga August 31 at 15-1 odds Last time out was another good effort - a third in the Grade 1 Vosburgh on this track September 28. Before the James Marvin he won three times and finished second twice in his five previous starts including a nice 3 1/2 length win in the 6 1/2 furlong minor Lion Cavern Stakes with a 104 Beyer Speed Figure at Belmont Park June 26 and an unfortunate 11 month layoff. Strapping Groom has eight wins, five seconds and two third place finishes in 23 career starts and enters the Bold Ruler as the 9-5 favorite on the morning line based on his recent success against top runners. Junior Alvarado gets the call from the far outside post Saturday on the 122-pound highweight. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-bold-ruler-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
									
				    <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-park-autumn-miss-stakes.html">Autumn Miss Stakes 2013 Contenders at Santa Anita Park</a> (Grade 3)</b>: <em><strong> <strong> - Wishing Gate</strong></strong></em> - Thomas Proctor trained filly has three wins and three seconds in nine career starts and has looked good recently - a second last time out in the Grade 1 Del Mar Oaks followed a win in her stakes debut in the Grade 2 San Clemente at 5-1 odds at Del Mar July 21. She also had a win in an Allowance Optional Claiming at Arlington Park June 23 after a second in an Allowance in May. Other notable career results include a second in the minor Surfer Girl Stakes at Santa Anita in October after an eighth in the Oak Tree Juvenile Fillies Turf in September. She has two wins and two seconds in her last four starts overall, has three wins and a second at one mile on grass and enters in very good form. Legendary Gary Stevens will in the saddle on the 122 pound highweight as the likely favorite Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-park-autumn-miss-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
				
				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-keeneland-race-course-fayette-stakes.html">Fayette Stakes 2013 Contenders at Keeneland </a> (Grade 1)</b>: <em><strong> <strong>Willcox Inn</strong></strong></em>  - finished a good second behind Skyring in the Dixie Stakes in May to follow a nice second in the Grade 2 Mervin H. Muniz March 30 at Fair Grounds. Before that was a fourth in the Grade 3 Fair Grounds Handicap in February and an OK third in the Grade 3 John B. Connally Turf Cup Stakes in January. He also had a disappointing ninth in the 2012 Breeders' Cup Mile. Last time out was a good third behind Silver Max and Wise Dan in the Grade 1 Shadwell Turf Mile October 5 after a great win in the Grade 3 Washington Park Handicap at Arlington Park August 31 and his worst effort of the year - a disappointing fifth in the Grade 1 United Nations July 6. Willcox Inn has won or placed in five of his seven previous races - all graded stakes and will have James Graham in the saddle from post 7.  <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-keeneland-race-course-fayette-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

Taylor Stakes 2013 Contenders at Woodbine</a> (Grade 1)</b>:  <em><strong>Irish Mission</strong></em>  - Canada's top 3-year-old filly last year hasn't looked great this year for trainer Mark Frostad. Last time out was an OK fourth in the Grade 1 Northern Dancer after a fifth in the Grade 2 Sky Classic and an Allowance score here July 24. She had some success earlier this year - a third in the Grade 3 Orchid at Gulfstream and a second in the Grade 2 Nassau on this track and she did win the Breeders' Stakes in Canada last year among her three victories in 2012 - so we know that she can run with the best. She will face females again after finding it tough sledding against males. She is the likely favorite Sunday although she is also entered in the $1 million Pattison Canadian International on the Sunday program at Woodbine. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-woodbine-racetrack-ep-taylor-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
