Post time is 5:40 PM. Let's take a brief look into the past performances of all nine combatants for this Grade 2 stakes - the last major prep for the Grade 2 Del Mar Derby September 1. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-del-mar-la-jolla-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
				
				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-fourstardave-handicap.html">Fourstardave Handicap at Saratoga Race Course</a> (Grade 2)</b>:  <em><strong>Wise Dan</strong></em> - How good was Wise Dan in 2012? He is the only horse since 1981 to win three Eclipse Awards in one night. He was the runaway winner in Horse of the Year, Four-year-old & up male and Male turf (3yo&up). He has won seven straight races ahead of the Fourstardave and 12 of his last 14 races overall including the Breeders' Cup in November. This year he looks to be on an Eclipse Award path once again - three starts and three impressive wins. Last time out was the Grade 3 Firecracker Handicap after the Woodford Reserve Turf Classic and the Maker's 46 Mile Stakes. He is simply the most dominant horse on the planet right now, is the defending champion in this race, will carry the highweight of 129 pounds and the one to beat Saturday! He is the 3-5 favorite on the morning line and will have John Velazquez in the saddle. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-fourstardave-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>

She had an OK third in the Grade 2 Fair Grounds Oaks March 30 after a four month layoff and followed that with an ugly ninth in the Grade 1 Kentucky Oaks. She has raced three straight Grade 3 stakes - a seventh in the Regret Stakes at Churchill Downs June 15, a good second in the Iowa Oaks June 29 and last time out a sixth in the Arlington Oaks. She has been inconsistent in her career but is the only stakes winner in the field. Saturday looks like a good opportunity to break a slump that dates back to November 24. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-monmouth-park-monmouth-oaks.html">Read More</a></p>

Frankel in December and the Grade 1 Matriarch Stakes in November.
