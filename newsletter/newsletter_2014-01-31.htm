					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-aqueduct-racetrack-withers-stakes.html">Wither Stakes (G3)</a> at Aqueduct</b>: <strong><em> Samraat </em></strong>- Richard Violette trained New York bred colt will try to remain perfect in his career. He has three starts and three wins - last time out in his stakes debut - the listed Damon Runyon Stakes by an astounding 16 3/4 lengths here December 18 after an Allowance score on this track November 22 and a MSW by 3 1/2 lengths score in his debut at Belmont Park in October. Samraat departs from post 5 as the 7-5 favorite Saturday with Jose Ortiz in the saddle. </p>
					
					<p><strong><em>Uncle Sigh</em></strong> - another New York bred will race for the third time for trainer Gary Contessa - both previous starts coming on this track. He broke maiden last time out December 27 by an incredible 14 1/2 lengths after a second in his debut - another MSW December 7. Uncle Sigh is listed as the 9-5 second choice and will line up from the rail with Pablo Morales aboard.  <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-aqueduct-racetrack-withers-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

He had a somewhat disappointing fourth in the Grade 3 Bold Ruler at Belmont Park October 26 after a third in the Grade 1 Vosburgh September 28 but has looked better in his last two starts. Last time out was a dominant 6 1/2 length win on this track in the minor Gravesend Handicap December 21 after a good second in the Grade 3 Fall Highweight here November 28. Strapping Groom has nine wins, six seconds and two third place finishes in 26 career starts and enters as 3-5 favorite for the Toboggan. He is a coupled entry rot trainer David Jacobson along with...

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-santa-anita-park-las-virgenes-stakes.html">Las Virgenes Stakes (G1)</a> at Santa Anita Park</b>: <strong><em> Streaming</em></strong> - The road to the Kentucky Oaks continues at Santa Anita with the Grade 1, $300,000, Las Virgenes. Bob Baffert trained filly looks to remain perfect in her short career Saturday. She is coming off a very impressive win over Taste Like Candy among others in the Grade 1 Hollywood Starlet at 11-1 odds December 7 after a MSW score in her debut November 15. Martin Garcia will be aboard from the far outside post in the 122 pound highweight's first start on dirt.

He has just two starts in 2013 - a terrific win in the Breeders' Cup Sprint on this track and an Allowance Optional Claiming score here October 14 after 14 months away. He has placed in all nine career starts with seven wins and is coming off by far his biggest score. Despite being lightly raced the last couple of years, it is hard to discount Street Circle in the Palos Verdes. He has posted three bullet workouts here in the lead-up to the Palos Verdes and will be handled by Martin Garcia from post 4 as the 123 pound highweight.
