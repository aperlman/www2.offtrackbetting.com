<p>At OffTrackBetting.com, we believe we've raised the bar to a new height when it comes to <strong>Player Rewards</strong>. We looked at some of our competitors reward programs and were confused - so many rules, exceptions and minimum thresholds to meet.</p> 
<p>Deciding which online Racebook gives you the greatest betting advantage comes down to simple arithmetic. For every $1,000 wagered, you can <strong>earn  cash rewards up to $120</strong> at OTB. That same $1,000 at another ADW  would get you at best $30, and that is only if you bet on specific "bonus tracks." <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse-racing-rewards.html"><strong>See Player Rewards Comparison</strong></a></p>

					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-gulfstream-park-fort-lauderdale-stakes.html">Fort Lauderdale Stakes at Gulfstream Park</a></b>: <strong><em>(Grade 2): Dominus</em></strong> - Todd Pletcher trained colt had four starts in 2012 including an impressive win over Data Link in the Grade 2 Bernard Baruch September 1 and an Allowance Optional Claiming score at Saratoga August 4. Since then Dominus has struggled to a sixth in the Grade 1 Shadwell Turf Mile behind Wise Dan and a fifth last time out in the Grade 3 Ack Ack Handicap at Churchill Downs November 2. Hopes are that a move back to turf will get Dominus back in the win column this weekend. </p> 
					<p> <strong>Nikki's Sandcastle</strong> - has 30 career starts with 8 wins. His last two starts have resulted in wins in minor stakes races - the El Prado Stakes December 22 here and the Starter Stakes December 1 also on this track. Before that he had two second place finishes - two minor stakes races and the Grade 2 Fayette Stakes three back at Keeneland in October. He has three wins and three seconds in his last seven starts and enters the Fort Lauderdale in the best form of his career.  <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-gulfstream-park-fort-lauderdale-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-san-fernando-stakes.html">San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita</a>  (Grade 2)</b>: <strong>Handsome Mike</strong> - has two wins in 12 career starts - a Maiden Special Weight score at Santa Anita in October and out of nowhere in the Grade 2 Pennsylvania Derby three back. Last time out was a disappointing tenth in the Grade 1 Hollywood Derby to follow another poor result - a ninth in the Breeders' Cup Classic. Handsome Mike placed in just two of his last nine starts and after an improbable Pennsylvania Derby win, he has not looked great. Trainer Doug O'Neill hopes a return to dirt and a cutback in distance will make Mike competitive again. He is the high weight and will wear blinkers Saturday. </p> 
					<p><strong>Fed Biz</strong> - Bob Baffert trained colt has three wins in seven career starts including two this year with all of his wins coming at one mile - the El Cajon Stakes August 31 at Del Mar followed an Allowance Optional Claiming score on this track back in February. Last time out was a disappointing sixth in the Grade 1 Malibu Stakes to follow an eighth in the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile and an OK third in the Grade 2 Indiana Derby October 6. Fed Biz looks for his first graded stakes win Saturday but enters in average form. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-san-fernando-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-san-gabriel-stakes.html">San Gabriel Stakes at Santa Anita</a> (Grade 3)</b>:  <strong><em> Jeranimo</em></strong> - Jeranimo returned to prominence recently with a win in the Grade 1 Shoemaker Mile after a decent second in the race before - the Grade 3 San Francisco Mile at Golden Gate. He was third in the Grade 2 Del Mar Mile August 26 - the third straight race in which he placed. Since then has been a sixth last time out in the Breeders' Cup Mile and a fourth last time out in the Grade 2 Citation Handicap at Hollywood Park November 23. He won this race in 2010 and was second behind Norvsky last year and will have new rider Rafael Bejarano in the saddle Sunday - history is certainly on Jeranimo's side!</p>
					<p><strong><em>Slim Shadey</em></strong> - had looked good before a fifth as favorite in the Grade 1 United Nations Stakes at Monmouth on July 7 and another fifth in the Grade 1 Eddie Read. He won the Grade 2 John Henry Turf Championship three back on September 30 but followed that up with a tepid eighth in the Breeders' Cup Turf and an OK fourth in the Hollywood Turf Cup last time out December 15. He had three straight second place finishes earlier in 2012 including the Grade 1 Charles Whittingham to Acclamation, in the Grade 1 Woodford Reserve Turf Classic at Churchill Downs and the Grade 1 San Luis Stakes on March 25. Slim Shadey was up and down last year but showed some serious form at times. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-san-gabriel-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
