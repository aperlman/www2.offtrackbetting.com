				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-travers-stakes.html">Travers Stakes 2013 Contenders at Saratoga Race Course</a> (Grade 1)</b>: <em><strong>Verrazano, Palace Malice & Orb.</strong></em> Doesn't get much better than this. <em><strong>Verrazano</strong></em> - One of two huge Todd Pletcher's hopefuls has just one bad start and that happened to come on the biggest stage - a fourteenth place finish as one of the favorites in the Kentucky Derby. He bounced back after that result however with a win in the Grade 3 Pegasus at Monmouth June 16 and followed that with another terrific win - in the Grade 1 Haskell Invitational July 28 also at Monmouth. He has won six of seven career starts including an impressive score with 101 Beyer Speed Figure in the Grade 2 Tampa Bay Derby March 9 after two starts and two more wins - an Allowance Optional Claiming by 16 3/4 lengths at Gulfstream February 2 with a Beyer Speed figure of 105 and a MSW score by 7 3/4 lengths in his debut January 1 also at Gulfstream. He also won the Grade 1 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct April 6 in the lead up to the Kentucky Derby. He is used to dominating - more is expected in the Travers. He goes off as the 2-1 favorite from post 3 with John Velazquez in the saddle even though he has never raced at Saratoga before. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-travers-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

He was a disappointing fifth in the Grade 3 Swale Stakes at Gulfstream March 2 after a good second in the Grade 2 Hutcheson Stakes as 9-5 favorite February 2 but has posted three terrific wins in his last three starts - in the Grade 3 Derby Trial by a neck over Capo Bastone April 27, the Grade 2 Woody Stephens over Declan's Warrior by three quarters of a length June 8 at Belmont Park and last time out in the Grade 2 Amsterdam on this track July 28. He has won five of seven career starts (three straight graded stakes starts) and enters as one of the hottest entries in the field. He has won at four different distances, is the 5-2 favorite and departs from post 2 with regular rider Joel Rosario in the saddle Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-kings-bishop-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

She has proven to be very competitive but takes a huge step up in competition Saturday. She will have Julien Leparoux in the saddle from post 5 and may not be the biggest name but is somehow the 5-2 morning line favorite. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-test-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					         
                    <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-del-mar-pacific-classic-stakes.html">Pacific Classic Stakes 2013 Contenders at Del Mar Race Track</a>  (Grade 1): </b><em><strong>Game on Dude vs Dullahan:</strong></em> <strong>Game on Dude</strong> - Bob Baffert trained gelding is a multiple Grade 1 winner and the defending runner up in this race - and he finished fourth in 2011. He has eight graded stakes scores in his last 11 starts - and has won all four of his starts this year including the Grade 2 Charles Town Classic over Clubhouse Ride back in April and last time out in the Grade 1 Hollywood Gold Cup. His only poor result the last year was in the Breeders' Cup Classic where he finished seventh. Game On Dude was a consideration for last year's Eclipse Award for older male and if not for Wise Dan, he may have been in the running this year again. He is the most accomplished entry in the field and will be looking to become only the second horse to win California's three biggest races - the Santa Anita Handicap, Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic in the same year. He is the 5-2 favorite for the Classic and departs from post 11. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-del-mar-pacific-classic-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

Before the trip she had three straight wins including the Grade 3 Sabin Stakes at Gulfstream, a repeat win in the Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic and a win in the Grade 1 Beldame at Belmont Park September 29. Last time out she returned to the winner's circle with an impressive 10 3/4 length score in the Grade 1 Delaware Handicap after a decent second in the Grade 2 Fleur de Lis Handicap at Churchill Downs June 15. She finished second in this race last year behind 10-1 shot Love and Pride and will be looking for a better result this year. Royal Delta is the overwhelming favorite at 2-5 odds and will break from post 2 with Mike Smith in the saddle. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-personal-ensign-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
