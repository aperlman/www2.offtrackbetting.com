<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-charles-town-classic.html"> G2 Charles Town Classic Preview, Entries & Odds</a></strong> - This week's featured race is Saturday's Grade 2 Charles Town Classic, which is one of the richest horse races in the world. The favorites in the three-turn, 1 1/8-mile race figure to be <strong>Donworth 3-1</strong>, who is coming out of a troubled trip in the Santa Anita Handicap for trainer Doug O'Neill; <strong>Page McKenney 6-1</strong>, who has won five of his last six starts for Pimlico-based Mary Eppler; and <strong>Stanford 9-2</strong>, who finished second, beaten a head by his Todd Pletcher-trained stablemate Blofeld, in the Grade 2 Gulfstream Park Handicap.  ...</p>


<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-keeneland-race-course-dixiana-elkhorn-stakes.html">G2 Elkhorn Stakes Preview, Entries & Odds at Keeneland</a></strong> -  <strong>Da Big Hoss 7-2</strong>  is a rebound candidate after a dull fifth at Gulfstream recently; his two starts in Florida this winter were not up to standard to him - perhaps he didn't care for the hard turf course there; sandwiched between those starts was a blowout win in the John Connally in which he beat <strong>Kaigun 5-2</strong>. The latter, in contrast, excelled at Gulfstream this winter; a miler earlier in his career, he has developed into a quality turf marathoner since the fall.  <strong>Twilight Eclipse 3-1</strong>was one of the best turf stayers in North America in 2014-2015; outrun in his last two starts, but one came in the Breeders' Cup Turf and the other when kicking off his year this winter in Florida.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-los-alamitos-great-lady-m-stakes.html"> G2 Great Lady M Stakes Preview, Entries at Los Alamitos</a></strong> - <strong>Fantastic Style</strong> will start in the G2 Great Lady M. Stakes at Los Alamitos with high expectations. Last year, she won her first graded stakes in the  Great Lady M. for fillies and mares at 6 1/2 furlongs but was sidelined for the rest of the year with muscle soreness. The Bob Baffert trained filly has five wins, a second and a third place finish in seven career starts.</p>
