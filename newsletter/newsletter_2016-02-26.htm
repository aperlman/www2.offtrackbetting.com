<p>As with the last time <strong>Mohaymen</strong> raced on the Kentucky Derby trail, the unbeaten Kiaran McLaughlin trainee will match up against a small but talented field in Saturday's Fountain of Youth Stakes.</p>

<p>The Grade II, $400,000 stop on the Road to the Derby features six promising 3-year-olds, with the most accomplished of them set to break from the outside post. Mohaymen cruised to win the Grade II Holy Bull on Jan. 30, also at south Florida's Gulfstream Park, after winning Aqueduct's Grade II Nashua and Remsen as a juvenile.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-gulfstream-park-palm-beach-stakes.html">Palm Beach Stakes at Gulfstream Park</a> - J R's Holiday </strong>- has eight starts already for trainer Jose Garoffalo with three wins, a second and a third place finish. He has won three of his last four starts ahead of this weekend since switching to turf- the minor $100,000 Kitten's Joy Stakes last time out January 30, an Allowance Optional Claiming December 13 and a maiden score in September - all results on this track. He makes his graded stakes debut having placed in his last five starts overall - in good form right now. Emisael Jaramillo gets the call from post 13.</p>


<p>In addition, Gulfstream Park will also be featuring the <strong>Grade 3 Herecomesthebride Stakes</strong>, as well as the <strong>Grade 3 Canadian Turf Stakes</strong>. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/">Read Race Previews &gt;&gt;</a> </p>
