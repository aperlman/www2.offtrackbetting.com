<p>The 2016 edition of the Grade 3 <strong>El Camino Real Derby at Golden Gate Fields</strong> has attracted a full field of 14 runners looking to earn some Kentucky Derby points and the lion's share of the $200,000 purse. This should be a good betting race given the field size and the great mix of runners. There's a few international shippers, a few horses trying a synthetic track for the first time, and some that are going a route distance for the first time. </p>
