<p><strong>Grand Arch (8-1)</strong>, Jim and Susan Hill's 7-year-old gelding will look to repeat his win in last year's race. He finished second in the 2014 edition to Seek Again. The race has drawn a quality field, including two horses from the red-hot Chad Brown barn in <strong>A Lot (12-1)</strong> and <strong>Takeover Target (7-2)</strong>. The field includes the Oceanport winner (<strong>Blacktype</strong>, 10-1), the top two finishers in the Dixie (<strong>Takeover Target and Force the Pass, 8-1).</strong> </p>
