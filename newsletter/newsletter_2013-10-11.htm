					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-athenia-stakes.html">Athenia Stakes Race Preview at Belmont Park</a>  (Grade 3): </b><em><strong>Pianist</strong></em> - Chad Brown trained filly has a couple straight wins last summer including the minor Given Stakes at Belmont Park in September. She followed that with a pair of fourths - the Grade 3 Pin Oak Valley View Stakes at Belmont Park and the Stardusk Stakes behind Channel Lady in November. She started 2013 with a good score in an Allowance Optional Claiming on February 7 and has been up and down in graded stakes action since. Last time out was a good second in the Grade 2 Ballston Spa at Saratoga August 24 after an OK third in the Grade 3 Dr. James Penny Memorial at Parx July 2 and her best career result - a win in the Grade 3 Gallorette Handicap over Hard Not to Like at Pimlico in May. She has five wins, two seconds and two third place finishes in 12 career starts. Pianist is assigned top weight of 123 pounds and will break from post 5 with Jose Ortiz riding for the first time. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-athenia-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
									
				    <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-knickerbocker-handicap.html">Knickerbocker Handicap 2013 Contenders at Belmont Park</a> (Grade 3)</b>: <em><strong> <strong>Boisterous</strong></strong></em> - - has won seven of his last 15 starts for trainer Shug McGaughey including the 2011 and 2012 Grade 3 Red Smith Stakes at Aqueduct and the 2011 and 2012 Knickerbocker Stakes also at Aqueduct. Last time out was a third in the Grade 2 Bowling Green here September 7 after worst performance in a year was an eighth in the Grade 1 Sword Dancer at Saratoga August 17. Before that was wins in the Grade 2 Monmouth Stakes June 9 and in the Grade 1 Man o' War Stakes July 13 at Belmont Park. Before those wins were second place finishes in the Grade 3 Ben Ali in April and the Grade 3 River City Handicap in November and another couple of wins. He now has four wins and two seconds and a third in his last eight starts overall and will be looking to get back on the winning track Saturday. Boisterous starts from the far outside post with Javier Castellano in the reigns and goes off as the 7-2 favorite. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-knickerbocker-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
				
				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-keeneland-race-course-queen-elizabeth-II-challenge-cup.html">Queen Elizabeth II Cup Stakes Race Preview at Keeneland</a> (Grade 1)</b>: <em><strong> <strong>Alterite </strong></strong></em>  - French bred filly made her North American debut last time out one to remember - a terrific win in the Grade 1 Garden City Stakes at Belmont Park September 14 after nine starts at home produces three wins, two seconds and a third place finish. She hadn't won since March before last time out and had some rough results in some big races in France - a sixth in the Grade 1 Prix de Diane Longines-French Oaks and a tenth in the Grade 1 Poule d'Essai des Pouliches-French One Thousand Guineas but sandwiched in there is a respectable second in the Grade 1 Pour Moi Coolmore Prix Saint-Alary in May. John Velazquez, aboard Alterite for the Garden City victory, has the call from post 4 as the likely favorite Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-keeneland-race-course-queen-elizabeth-II-challenge-cup.html">Read More</a></p>

He has just five starts this year - a reasonable second in the Grade 2 Connaught Cup Stakes May 26 after eight months away and a repeat win in the Grade 2 King Edward Stakes June. Last time out was a fourth in the very tough Woodbine Mile September 15 after an OK third in the Grade 3 Play the King Stakes August 25 and his worst effort in quite some time - an ugly seventh in the Grade 2 Nijinsky July 21. He has nine wins, three seconds and three third place finishes in 25 career starts but does have three wins, two seconds and a third in his last nine starts overall. He is the most decorated entry in the field and the likely favorite Sunday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-woodbine-racetrack-nearctic-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
