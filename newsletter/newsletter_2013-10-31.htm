					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-breeders-cup-classic.html">BREEDERS' CUP CLASSIC</a> at Santa Anita (Grade 1)</b>: <strong><em>Game on Dude</em></strong> - Bob Baffert trained gelding is a multiple Grade 1 winner will be looking to avenge a seventh place finish in this race last year (he finished second in 2011). He has nine graded stakes scores in his last 12 starts - and has won all five of his starts this year including the Grade 2 Charles Town Classic over Clubhouse Ride back in April, the Grade 1 Hollywood Gold Cup and last time out the Grade 1 Pacific Classic at Del Mar August 25 in the second fastest time recorded in that race in the last 10 years. He enters having won seven of his last eight starts - the only blemish coming in the 2012 Classic. Game On Dude was a consideration for last year's Eclipse Award for older male and if not for Wise Dan, he may have been in the running this year again. He has been the most impressive horse on the planet this year and goes off as the 8-5 favorite on his home track for the Classic. Mike Smith will get the mount from post 9.</p> 
					<p><em><strong>Mucho Macho Man</strong></em> - has been terrific in his last 11 starts overall - five wins, two second, three thirds and 1 unfortunate DNF at the Sunshine Million Classic at Gulfstream in January. Last time out was an impressive win in the Grade 1 Awesome Again Stakes here September 28 after a good third in the Grade 1 Whitney Invitational at Saratoga August 3 and a third in the minor Criminal Type Stakes at Belmont Park in June. He had a good second to Fort Larned in last year's Breeders' Cup Classic and will be looking to better that this year. Also in 2012 he had a second in the Grade 1 Woodward at Saratoga September 1 and a win at the Grade 2 Suburban by an easy two and a half lengths July 7. Mucho Macho Man has seven wins, five seconds and six third place finishes in 22 career starts and has been at or near the top in every race the last two years. He departs from post 6 with the legendary Gary Stevens in the saddle. He is currently listed as the 5-1 second choice. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-breeders-cup-classic.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-breeders-cup-mile.html">BREEDERS' CUP MILE</a> at Santa Anita (Grade 1)</b>:  <strong><em>Wise Dan</em></strong>  - The terrific three-time Eclipse Award winning Wise Dan proved he was mortal last time out - he finished second! That's right - he lost the Grade 1 Shadwell Turf Mile October 5 at Keeneland! He is the only horse since 1981 to win three Eclipse Awards in one night. He was the runaway winner in Horse of the Year, Four-year-old & up male and Male turf (3yo&up). He has won nine straight races ahead of the Shadwell and 14 of his last 16 races overall including last year's Breeders' Cup Mile. This year he looks to be on an Eclipse Award path once again - six starts and five impressive wins. They include the Grade 1 Woodbine Mile to follow the Grade 2 Fourstardave Handicap at Saratoga August 1, the Grade 3 Firecracker Handicap in June, and the Woodford Reserve Turf Classic in May and the Maker's 46 Mile Stakes in April. He is simply the most dominant horse on the planet right now and is the defending champion in this race - the unquestioned favorite Saturday. John Velazquez will be in the saddle from post 8 as he goes off at even odds.</p>
					<p><strong><em>Olympic Glory</em></strong> - broke his maiden at Goodwood in his 2-year-old debut before finishing a close second to England's 2-year-old champion Dawn Approach 11 days later. The colt went on to win four straight group stakes races to finish out his 2-year-old season and to begin his 3-year-old season. He ran into hard luck this season, finishing second by a short head to Moonlight Cloud in France followed by another second at Longchamp a month later. The Choisir son finished his European season with a win in the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He is the 4-1 second choice on the morning line and departs from post 5 Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-breeders-cup-mile.html">Read More</a></p>

                    <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-breeders-cup-distaff.html">BREEDERS' CUP DISTAFF - Former Ladies' Classic</a> at Santa Anita (Grade 1)</b>: <strong><em>Royal Delta</em></strong> - back-to-back Female Horse of the Year in the United States for trainer Bill Mott and two-time defending champion in this race has looked exceptional of late except for a doomed trip to Dubai where she finished tenth in the World Cup. Before the trip she had three straight wins including the Grade 3 Sabin Stakes at Gulfstream, a repeat win in the Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic and a win in the 2012 Beldame at Belmont Park September 29. She had a two race win streak this summer interrupted by a second last time out to Princess Of Sylmar in the Grade 1 Beldame at Belmont Park September 28 - the wins include an impressive 10 3/4 length score in the Grade 1 Delaware Handicap July 20 and the Grade 1 Personal Ensign at Saratoga August 25. She has owned this race the last two years and enters this year having won three times and finished second twice in five starts (minus her Dubai experience). Royal Delta is the 8-5 favorite for the Distaff and leaves from post 4 with Mike Smith in the saddle. </p>
					<p><strong><em>Princess Of Sylmar </em></strong> - stellar Todd Pletcher pupil has won eight of her nine starts (six of seven this year) - a second in the Grade 2 Gazelle Stakes to Close Hatches at Aqueduct April 6 being the only blemish in the last 12 months. The wins include the Grade 1 Beldame last time out over Royal Delta, the Grade 1 Alabama Stakes August 17, the Grade 1 American Oaks July 20 at Saratoga, the Grade 1 Kentucky Oaks at 38-1 odds over Dreaming of Julia, the minor Busher Stakes at Aqueduct February 2 and the Busanda Stakes by 7 1/2 lengths January 4. She also has a MSW and an Allowance Optional Claiming score. She is absolutely on fire and has four straight Grade 1 wins under her belt ahead of this weekend. She is on a path toward the Eclipse Award - a good showing Friday will certainly clinch those honors. Princess of Sylmar is listed as the 9-5 second choice and departs from the outside post with Javier Castellano aboard. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-breeders-cup-distaff.html">Read More</a></p>
