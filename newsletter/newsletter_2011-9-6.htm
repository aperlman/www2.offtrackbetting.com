                    Live Thoroughbred racing returns to Turfway Park on September 8, with a packed slate of events over 16 racing days, a new Pick 5 wager, and the renaissance of the Kentucky Cup Day of Champions under sponsorship by WinStar Farm. Turfway introduces the daily 50-cent Pick 5 wager to its menu this season, replacing the Pick 6. The new wager requires players to choose the winners of five consecutive races beginning with the 3rd race. If no perfect tickets are sold, the wager pays 25 percent of the pool to those holding the most winners and the rest carries over to the next racing day. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/">Bet Now</a>

                    <span>

OTB's Carryover Pool Calendar always lets you know which race tracks are offering the biggest pools for that day. <br><br>
<em>Why follow Carryovers?</em> Easy answer - The magic of horse racing betting carryovers is twofold. First, money   attracts money so players know there's a chance for a life changing   payout. In addition, value conscious horse players wait for carryovers   to jump in because they recognize that they're getting a unique bonus -   more money is being paid out than has been wagered that day, so instead   of a takeout, there's an effective &quot;put in&quot; for those who stayed out of   the previous days' pools. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/carryovers.html">Click Here</a> to view.</span>
