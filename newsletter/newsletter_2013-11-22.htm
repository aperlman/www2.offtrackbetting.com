					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-delta-downs-jackpot-stakes.html">Delta Downs Jackpot Stakes</a> at Delta Downs (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em>Coastline</em></strong> - Mark Casse trained colt won his stakes debut last time out - the minor Street Sense Stakes over Almost Famous by an impressive three lengths at Churchill Downs October 27 after breaking maiden by 3 1/2 lengths in his second career start. He debuted September 13 and finished second to Almost Famous in a MSW at Churchill Downs for his only other career result. Coastline is expected to carry momentum from his impressive stakes debut into his first graded stakes start Saturday - he is 5-2 on the morning line and departs from post 2 with Shaun Bridgmohan in the saddle.</p> 
					<p><em><strong>Rise Up</strong></em> - Thomas Amoss trained colt is coming off a terrific 6 1/2 length win in the minor Jean Lafitte Stakes on this track October 26 after a sixth in his only graded stakes action - the Grade 3 Iroquois at Churchill Downs September 7. He also won the minor Mountaineer Juvenile in relatively easy fashion August 3 and had a MSW score right before that. Except for one bad result Rise Up has been in the mix every time out - three wins and a second in five career starts. Rise Up is the morning line second choice at 3-1 odds and will line up in post 10 with Gerald Melancon aboard. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-delta-downs-jackpot-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-delta-downs-princess-stakes.html">Princess Stakes 2013 Contenders & Odds</a> at Delta Downs (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em>Concave </em></strong>- West Coast shipper Doug O`Neill trained filly won the Grade 1 Sorrento Stakes at Del Mar August 7 after a MSW score in her debut. She was a respectable third behind She`s a Tiger in the Grade 1 Del Mar Debutante August 31 and most recently finished a disappointing ninth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies - the only time she finished out of the money in her four career starts. Doug O'Neill has a good history in this race and we all know what Mario Gutierrez did on I'll Have Another!</p> 
					<p><em><strong>Miss Behavior</strong></em> - has four career starts for trainer Phil Schoenthal with three impressive wins including the Grade 2 Matron Stakes at Belmont Park September 29 and one-second place finish which came last time out to Tea Time in the minor Sharp Cat Stakes at Belmont Park October 27. She stretches out and races away from home for the first time Saturday looking like the one to catch. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-delta-downs-princess-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
