					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-charles-town-classic-stakes.html">2013 Charles Town Classic Stakes</a></b>: <strong> - (Grade 2</strong>): <strong>Game on Dude</strong>  - Bob Baffert trained gelding is a multiple Grade 1 winner. He has six graded stakes scores in his last nine starts & was a consideration for last year's Eclipse Award for older male and if not for Wise Dan, he may have been in the running this year again.</p> 
					<p> <strong>Ron the Greek</strong> -  looked very good in 2012 with two wins and three second place finishes in five starts before a sixth in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park September 29 and an OK fourth in the Breeders' Cup Classic in November. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-charles-town-classic-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-hawthorne-race-course-illinois-derby.html">Illinois Derby at Hawthorne Race Course</a>  (Grade 3)</b>: <strong>Departing</strong> - has four career starts for trainer Albert Stall Jr. and three wins - the last and most impressive being at the minor Texas Heritage Stakes at Sam Houston March 2. Before that was an Allowance Optional Claiming score here in January and a MSW score in her career debut December 22. Last time out was a good third in the Grade 2 Louisiana Derby March 30 at Fair Grounds which was enough to make him the morning line favorite.</p> 
					<p><strong>Siete de Oros</strong> - has seven career starts with two wins - a Maiden Claiming and an Allowance at Parx. He had a second by a head in the Grade 2 Jerome Stakes at 41-1 odds at Aqueduct January 5 behind Vyjack and had two third place finishes recently - two back in the Grade 3 Withers and in the minor Pennsylvania Nursery Stakes at Parx December 8. Last time out was a fourth place finish in the Grade 3 Gotham Stakes at Aqueduct March 2. He has been at or near the top in every one of his seven career starts and is certainly a threat in the Illinois Derby. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-hawthorne-race-course-illinois-derby.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-keeneland-race-course-coolmore-lexington-stakes.html">Coolmore Lexington Stakes at Keeneland Race Course</a> (Grade 3)</b>:  

 
                    <strong>Pure Fun </strong>  - Kenneth McPeek trained filly is coming off an OK third in the Grade 3 Fathead Bourbonette March 23 after a terrific win in the Grade 1 Hollywood Starlet Stakes at Hollywood Park December 8 and an Allowance Optional Claiming score at Churchill Downs in November by 9 1/4 lengths. In her other six career starts she managed a win, a second and a third place finish. She has been impressive the last six months and should give the boys a good run for their money on Saturday as she tries to gather points for the Kentucky Oaks, not the Derby - she needs a win to qualify.</p>
					<p><strong>Cerro</strong> - Irish bred son of Mr. Greeley and H. Graham Motion trainee Cerro has six career starts with two wins - in his debut at Milan and last time out in an Allowance Optional Claiming here January 26 after a third and a fourth respectively in similar races. His North American debut was a sixth in the Grade 3 Pilgrim Stakes at Belmont Park in June. He is coming off a sixth in the Grade 2 Fountain of Youth Stakes February 23 after an Allowance Optional Claiming score January 26 at Gulfstream. He needs a win here for a possible spot in the Preakness Stakes May 18 - the Kentucky Derby is already out of reach. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-keeneland-race-course-coolmore-lexington-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
