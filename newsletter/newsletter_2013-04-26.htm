					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-westchester-stakes.html">Westchester Stakes at Belmont Park</a></b>: <strong> - (Grade 3</strong>): <strong>Flat Out</strong> - won the 2011 Jockey Club Gold Cup and repeated that score September 29 on this track. He was a decent third in the Breeders' Cup Classic and also had a very good second in the Grade 2 Monmouth Cup July 7 before an OK third in the Grade 1 Whitney Invitational Handicap August 4. He has finished off the board in his last two starts after placing in four straight stakes - a fourth in the Grade 1 Donn February 9 was followed by a fifth last time out in the Grade 2 New Orleans Handicap at Fair Grounds March 30. Flat Out always saves his best for Belmont and despite being third choice on the morning line is the one to watch Saturday.</p> 
					<p> <strong>Big Screen</strong> - has two Allowance Optional Claiming scores and a second place finish in three starts in 2013 and appears to be in the best form of his career although he hasn't raced in graded stakes company since June - a ninth in the Grade 3 Hill Prince Stakes here and a fifth in May in the Grade 2 Peter Pan also on this track. He is the morning line second choice and based on recent form should challenge the bigger names Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-westchester-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-golden-gate-fields-san-francisco-mile.html">San Francisco Mile at Golden Gate Fields</a>  (Grade 3)</b>: <strong>Hudson Landing</strong>  - is the defending champion in this race over Gallant Son and Jeranimo and also won the Grade 3 All American Stakes on this track in November for his best result since the San Francisco Mile score. This year he has a pair of third place finishes - an Allowance Optional Claiming last time out April 6 here behind Control Seeker who is also entered in the San Francisco Mile and in an Allowance also on this track March 15. He won five of 12 starts last year and looks to be in decent form for his repeat effort this weekend.</p> 
					<p><strong>Summer Hit</strong> - makes his graded stakes debut for trainer Jerry Hollendorfer having win six of nine career starts with a second and two third place finishes. He has four of his last five ahead of the San Francisco Mile including the minor Silky Sullivan Stakes last June on this track and an Allowance by 3 1/4 lengths March 31 at Santa Anita. Saturday marks a huge step up in competition but there is no denying that Summer Hit is a winner! <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-golden-gate-fields-san-francisco-mile.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-hollywood-park-wilshire-handicap.html">Wilshire Handicap at Hollywood Park</a> (Grade 3)</b>:  

 
                    <strong>Halo Dolly </strong> - had seven wins in 12 races in 2012 including the minor Miss America Stakes in October and he best result - a win in the Grade 2 Yellow Ribbon Stakes at Del Mar on September 3. Other wins include the minor Solana Beach Handicap, the Alameda County Fillies and Mares Stakes and the Fran's Valentine Stakes in her only start on this track. Her last two starts have also come on this track - a third last time out in the minor Golden Poppy Stakes as heavy favorite April 7 followed a third in an Allowance in March after a couple of off the board finished in two starts prior - a fourth in the Grade 3 Robert J. Frankel and a sixth in the minor Valentine Dancer at Santa Anita in January. She is the most accomplished of the entries and the one to beat Sunday.</p>
					<p><strong>Purim's Dancer </strong> - Thomas Proctor trained filly made her graded stakes debut after with a third place finish last time out in the Grade 3 Las Cienegas Stakes at Santa Anita April 13 after four wins in last five starts - the restricted Wishing Well Stakes at Santa Anita by 3 1/4 lengths February 10, an Allowance Optional Claiming January 18, a Starter Claiming in October and a MSW in September. Her only two career blemishes came last time out with that respectable third and in her debut and in December - an Allowance at Hollywood Park. She has four wins and two third place finishes in seven career starts and has won four of five starts on turf - she has to be on the radar for the Wilshire. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-hollywood-park-wilshire-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
