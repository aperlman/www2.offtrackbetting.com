<p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0px; clear:both; padding-top:15px;">  <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-parx-racing-pennsylvania-derby.html">Nyquist, Exaggerator go at it again in Pennsylvania Derby</a>  </p>

<p>With the 3-year-old male division extremely tight at the top, a pivotal matchup will take place at Parx Racing on Saturday when Nyquist and Exaggerator meet in the $1.25 million Pennsylvania Derby.</p>

<p>On Monday, <strong>Nyquist drew post 9 and Exaggerator post 2</strong> when 12 were entered in the Grade 2, 1 1/8-mile Pennsylvania Derby. As usual, Mario Gutierrez will be aboard Nyquist for trainer Doug O'Neill, and Kent Desormeaux will ride Exaggerator for his brother, Keith.</p>


<p>Some are saying Saturday's Pa. Derby at Parx likely will decide the 3-year-old championship right then and there. Nyquist and Exaggerator have faced each other four times this year, Nyquist winning the San Vicente and Kentucky Derby, Exaggerator the Preakness and Haskell. If either wins the Pa. Derby, that would be a fourth graded stakes this year in long campaigns, a resume that would be hard even for runaway Travers winner Arrogate, should he also win the Breeders' Cup Classic, to top.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-parx-racing-cotillion-stakes.html"> G1 Cotillion Stakes Preview, Entries & Odds at Parx</a> - Songbird 1-2 </strong> - Jerry Hollendorfer trained undefeated superstar filly and reigning Eclipse Award winner for two year old fillies won all four of her starts in 2015, the last three in Grade 1 events. She hasn't been touched yet - six gate-to-wire wins in 10 starts - by a combined 50 lengths - as impressive as any horse in any division. She will look to keep the incredible roll going Saturday - from post with Mike Smith aboard the obvious favorite.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-belmont-park-noble-damsel-stakes.html"> G2 Noble Damsel Stakes Preview at Belmont Park</a></strong> - Eight older females will give it a go in the Noble Damsel - race 8 on Belmont Park's Saturday card. <strong>Mrs McDougal 9-5</strong> - has four wins and two third place finishes in 10 career starts for trainer Chad Brown. Last time out was a bit of a step back however - a seventh in the Grade 1 Diana Stakes at Saratoga July 23. Mrs McDougal had looked good before last time out and will be after a strong bounce back with Irad Ortiz in the irons of the only graded stakes winner in the field and morning line favorite from post 5.</p>
