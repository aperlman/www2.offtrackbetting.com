					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-churchill-downs-kentucky-derby.html">139th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs</a></b>: <strong> - (Grade 1</strong>): <strong>Orb</strong> - Claude R. McGaughey III trained colt enters the Kentucky Derby on a three race win streak - an impressive score last time out in the Grade 1 Florida Derby March 30 at Gulfstream followed a win in the Grade 2 Fountain of Youth Stakes (largely because of the omissions of Itsmyluckyday and Shanghai Bobby for that race) February 23 and an Allowance Optional Claiming score January 26. He also had a MSW win at Aqueduct November 24. He has those four wins and a third place finish in his seven career starts and seems to be improving drastically each and every time out.</p> 
					<p> <strong>Verrazano</strong> - probably Todd Pletcher's best chance made his stakes debut with an impressive score with 101 Beyer Speed Figure in the Grade 2 Tampa Bay Derby March 9 after two starts and two more wins - an impressive Allowance Optional Claiming by 16 3/4 lengths at Gulfstream February 2 with a Beyer Speed figure of 105 and a MSW score by 7 3/4 lengths in his debut January 1 also at Gulfstream. Last time out he made it 4-for-4 in his career with another impressive win in the Grade 1 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct April 6. He was the top point getter on the Road to the Kentucky Derby and is one of the colts everyone is looking at ahead of the Derby. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-churchill-downs-kentucky-derby.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-churchill-downs-kentucky-oaks.html">139th Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs</a>  (Grade 1)</b>: <strong>Dreaming of Julia</strong>  - Todd Pletcher filly entered the Breeders' Cup in November having started three career races and winning all - a win on August 6 by an astounding 10 1/2 lengths at Saratoga was followed by an equally impressive 16 1/4 length score in the Meadow Star Classic on September 9. She was impressive in winning the Grade 1 Frizette Stakes at Belmont October 6 before an OK third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. She followed that with a second in the Grade 2 Davona Dale Stakes to Live Lively February 23 and most recently returned to her winning ways with a nice win in the Grade 2 Gulfstream Oaks March 30 by an incredible 21 3/4 lengths. She has six career starts with four wins, a second and a third place finish and is the morning line favorite for the Oaks.</p> 
					<p><strong>Beholder</strong> - 2012 Eclipse Award winner as 2-year-old filly has eight career starts with five wins and two second place finishes. She won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies in November for her second straight win and followed that with a second as overwhelming favorite in the Grade 2 Santa Ynez behind Renee's Titan here January 21. She avenged her defeat to Renee's Titan with an impressive win in the Grade 1 Las Virgenes Stakes March 2 and went on to win the Grade 1 Santa Anita Oaks April 6 at Santa Anita. She is the reigning Eclipse Award winner for a reason - she is mighty impressive. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-churchill-downs-kentucky-oaks.html">Read More</a></p>

                    <strong>Dream Peace </strong> - Grade 2 winner in France has raced all around the world with mixed results - four wins, two seconds and six third place finishes in 16 career starts. Last time out was a decent third in the Grade 3 E.P. Taylor Stakes at Woodbine back in October (she won the E.P. Taylor in 2011) after an OK third Grade 1 Flower Bowl Invitational, a very good second in the Grade 1 Diana Stakes at Saratoga July 28 and a pair of pedestrian results overseas. Dream Peace has placed in her last three starts overall but hits the track for the first time in six months Saturday. She is your morning line favorite.
