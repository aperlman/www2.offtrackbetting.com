<p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0px; clear:both; padding-top:15px;"><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/">OPENING DAY at DEL MAR</a> </b></p>
<p>Del Mar's summertime 40-day meeting will feature 43 stakes events, topped by the $1,000,000 Pacific Classic and worth a total of $7,950,000 in black-type purses. The historic track will present its bountiful slate during its 76th season of seaside sport starting on Thursday, July 16 and running through Labor Day Monday, September 7 </p>


<p>All told, the track will offer 21 Graded stakes - seven of them Grade I, 10 at Grade II and four at Grade III. Twenty three of the track's stakes will be run on its newly renovated main track, which - after a seven-year period of racing on a synthetic surface called by the brand name Polytrack - has been returned to dirt over this past winter. The new surface is the well-regarded "El Segundo sand," the same material Santa Anita racetrack used in its remake of its main track. The remaining 20 stakes on the Del Mar roster will be presented on its turf course, which was planted anew and expanded for the start of the 2014 summer season. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/">LOG IN &gt;&gt;</a> </p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-delaware-handicap.html">Delaware Handicap 2015 at Delaware Park</a> - (Grade 1)</b>: <em><strong>Sheer Drama 2/1</strong></em> won the minor Thirty Eight Go Go Stakes at Laurel Park in September and went on to a ninth in the minor H.B.P.A Stakes at Presque Isle Downs September 25. She has been consistently good in five starts in 2015 however - a win in the Grade 2 Royal Delta Stakes at Gulfstream in March and four runner-up finishes - all in stakes company. She enters this week on the heels of two of those second place finishes -behind Frivolous as favorite in the Grade 2 Fleur de Lis Handicap June 13 and the Grade 1 La Troienne Stakes May 1 - both results at Churchill Downs. Sheer Drama now has 17 career starts overall with four wins, eight seconds and a third place finish and enters this week having been in every race the last six months and in the best form of her career. Joe Bravo has been tabbed to ride the morning line favorite from post 5 Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-delaware-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>

<p><em><strong> Frivolous 3/1 </strong></em> - has 20 career starts for trainer Victoria Oliver with four wins, three seconds and three third place finishes and enters off a good win at 32-1 odds in the Grade 2 Fleur de Lis Handicap at Churchill Downs June 13. That result followed a disappointing ninth in the Grade 1 La Troienne Stakes, a sixth in an Allowance Optional Claiming in April and another good win in the Grade 2 Falls City Handicap to end her 2014 campaign. Frivolous has been a tad inconsistent but when right is a serious threat as evidenced by her win last time out. Jon Kenton Court gets the call aboard the morning line second choice from the rail. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-delaware-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
