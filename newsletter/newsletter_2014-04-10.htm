					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-keeneland-race-course-toyota-blue-grass-stakes.html">Bluegrass Stakes 2014 (G1)</a> at Keeneland, Saturday, April 12 </b>: The "Road to the Kentucky Derby" makes a stop at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Kentucky this Saturday, April 12. The Toyota Blue Grass Stakes will offer up one of the final chances for three year olds to gather points toward qualification into the Run for the Roses in less than a month's time. The hopefuls will go 1 1/8 miles on Keeneland's main track for a very nice purse of $750,000. </p>

					  Bobby's Kitten  </em></strong> - Chad Brown trained colt broke maiden August 23 in wire-to-wire fashion in his second career start at Saratoga after a third in his debut July 27 also at Saratoga. He went on to an impressive 6 1/4 length score in the Grade 2 Pilgrim Stakes at Belmont Park October 6 and finished a decent third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf. Last time out was another win - a one mile Allowance score in gate-to-wire fashion at Tampa Bay Downs March 8 making it three wins and two third place finishes in five career starts. He makes his first start on Polytrack and his fist start off grass as the favorite Saturday. Javier Castellano gets the mount from post 5. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-keeneland-race-course-toyota-blue-grass-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					<p><strong><em> Medal Count </em></strong>- Dale Romans trained colt is coming off a win just last week in the Grade 3 Transylvania Stakes on this track April 4 after a fifth in the Grade 2 Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream February 22, an Allowance Optional Claiming score January 12 and an eleventh in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. That followed an equally disappointing fifth in the Grade 3 Bourbon Stakes at Keeneland in October and a MSW score in his career debut - at Ellis Park September 1. Medal Count hadn't been great in his graded stakes action but his effort on this track last week certainly opened some eyes. He is the second choice on the morning line. Robby Alvarado will be in the saddle from gate 13.

He was the runaway winner in Horse of the Year, Four-year-old & up male and Male turf (3yo&up) in 2013 and 2014. He has won 10 of his 11 last races ahead of this weekend and 15 of his last 17 races overall including the ...

					  <p><strong><em>Lochte</em></strong> - Marcus Vitali trained gelding failed to place in his first two career starts but has hit the board in his other nine career starts including three wins, three seconds and three third place finishes. He enters off a second in the Grade 1 Frank E. Kilroe Mile at Santa Anita March 8 after his best career performance - a win in the Grade 1 Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap at 39-1 odds February 9 and after winning two of his previous three starts... <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-keeneland-race-course-makers-46-mile.html">Read More</a></p>

She has six graded stakes wins but had a disappointing fifth in the Grade 1 Diana Stakes behind Laughing July 27 after a fourth in the Just a Game Stakes after getting caught in traffic June 8 - both results before the Ballston Spa. Before her recent three race slump...

					 <p><strong><em>Stephanie's Kitten</em></strong> - had a very productive Juvenile campaign in which she won or placed in all five starts (three wins and two third place finishes). Among Stephanie's Kitten's impressive wins are the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf and the Grade 1 Darley Alcibiades Stakes. Stephanie's Kitten was a leading Juvenile filly on dirt and turf in 2011 and looked OK in 2012 as well - wins in the Grade 1 Lake Placid Stakes and the minor Edgewood Stakes at Churchill Downs in May... <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-keeneland-race-course-jenny-wiley-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
