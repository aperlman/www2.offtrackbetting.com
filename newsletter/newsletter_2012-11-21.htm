			<p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0px;"><b>GRADED STAKES RACE PREVIEWS & FAVORITES</b></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-aqueduct-fall-highweight-handicap.html">FALL HIGHWEIGHT</a> at Aqueduct (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em>Poseidon's Warrior</em></strong> - most recently finished a disappointing fourteenth in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. He came out of nowhere and won the Grade 1 Vanderbilt Handicap August 5 at 36-1 odds however at Saratoga and followed that with another reasonable effort - a third in the Grade 1 Vosburgh September 29 - those two results being the only money finishes he's had this year. He was in decent form before the Breeders' Cup and will be looking to rebound from an ugly result last time out.</p> 
					<p><em><strong>Caixa Electronica</strong></em>- Todd Pletcher trained Caixa Electronica had won two big races in three starts - the Grade 2 Charles Town Classic Stakes on April 4 and the Grade 2 True North Handicap on June 8 before stumbling in the next three races - a fifth in the Grade 3 James Marvin on July 20, an eighth in the Grade 1 Whitney Invitational on August 4 and a fourth in the Grade 1 Forgo on September 1. He had a good second to The Lumber Guy in the Grade 1 Vosburgh at September 29 but finished seventh last time out on the Grade 3 Bold Ruler. Caixa Electronica is hot and cold as they come - three good wins, a second and a third in 11 starts this year to go with some seriously unflattering results. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-aqueduct-fall-highweight-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-hollywood-park-citation-handicap.html">CITATION HANDICAP</a> at Hollywood Park (Grade 2)</b>:  <strong><em>Jeranimo</em></strong> - Jeranimo returned to prominence most recently with a win in the Grade 1 Shoemaker Mile after a decent second in the race before - the Grade 3 San Francisco Mile at Golden Gate. He was third in the Grade 2 Del Mar Mile August 26 - the third straight race in which he placed before a sixth last time out in the Breeders' Cup Mile. His other results in 2012 include a fourth in the Grade 1 Frank Kilroe and a second at the Grade 2 San Gabriel on January 16. Despite flying under the radar a tad this year, he has finished in the money in four of six races and as the defending champion in this race and winner of three of four starts on this track he is the likely favorite.</p>
					<p><strong><em>Ultimate Eagle</em></strong> - Ultimate Eagle debuted on dirt at The Strub Stakes, won that race over Tapizar and holds surprising wins in the Grade 3 Oak Tree Derby and the Grade 1 Hollywood Derby last November on this very track. He has been out of action since a very disappointing tenth in the Grade 1 Hollywood Park Handicap March 3 as 2-1 favorite. He has won five of his last seven starts overall and will be looking to shake the rust and a disappointing effort last time out in this one. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-hollywood-park-citation-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>

                    <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-aqueduct-go-for-wand-handicap.html">GO FOR WAND HANDICAP</a> at Aqueduct (Grade 2)</b>: <strong><em>Fantasy of Flight</em></strong> - Richard Dutrow filly is the morning line favorite and is coming off a very nice 9 3/4 length win in an Optional Claiming race last time out after a less-than-impressive ninth in the Grade 1 Humana Distaff at Churchill Downs way back in May. She has three wins, three seconds and a third place finish in eight career starts including a decent second in the Grade 3 Dogwood last June at Churchill Downs and appears in fine form after her decisive romp last time out. </p>
					<p><strong><em>Willet</em></strong> - has won four of her last six starts and has placed in all seven career starts but will be making her graded stakes debut on Friday. Willet is coming off a very impressive 9 1/4 length win in the Iroquois Stakes at Belmont Park last time out and has won her last two starts on this track. The Go For Wand is a huge step up in competition but the James Iselin trained filly appears up to the task and is the morning line second choice. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-aqueduct-go-for-wand-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
