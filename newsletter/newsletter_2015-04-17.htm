It is race 12 on Charles Town's Saturday card with a post time is 6:05 PM. </p>
<p><b>Shared Belief 2-5</b> - Jerry Hollendorfer trained, Jim Rome owned colt rebounded from a controversial fourth as favorite in the Breeders' Cup Classic - his only career loss with a good win in the Grade 1 Malibu Stakes December 26 and followed that with another win by 1 1/2 over California Chrome in the Grade 2 San Antonio Stakes February 7 and a terrific score last time out in the Grade 1 Santa Anita Handicap March 7. The 2013 Eclipse award winner for two year old colts won the Grade 1 Awesome Again Stakes September 27, the Grade 2 Los Alamitos Derby July 5, an Allowance at Golden Gate May 26, the Grade 1 CashCall Futurity by 5 3/4 lengths, the Grade 3 Hollywood Prevue Stakes and a MSW at first asking.

Allen Jerkens Stakes at Gulfstream Park January 31. Sandwiched between the wins were three off-the-board finishes - a fourth in the Grade 3 WL McKnight Handicap in December, a fourth in the Grade 3 Red Smith Handicap in November and a fifth in the Grade 3 Sycamore Stakes here in October. Unitarian has 19 career starts with five wins, three seconds and four third place finishes and should be in the mix Saturday after regaining some confidence last time out.
