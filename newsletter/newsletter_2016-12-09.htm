<p>The $300,000-guaranteed Starlet for 2-year-old fillies & will be run at 1 1/16 miles. The Starlet, whose past winners include Althea, Very Subtle, Goodbye Halo, Sardula, Serena's Song, Surfside, Blind Luck and Take Charge Brandi, is part of the <strong>"Road to the Kentucky Oaks"</strong> series. The winner Saturday will receive 10 points towards earning a berth in the Kentucky Oaks next May 5 in Louisville.</p>

<p><strong>American Gal 5-2</strong>  - up-and-coming Bob Baffert trained filly has three career starts and two wins and a third place finish. She made her graded stakes debut last time out and finished a very respectable third as favorite - after a troubled trip in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies November 5. American Gal has been competitive every time out and looks to be in good shape to claim her first graded stakes score. Regular rider Mike Smith will try to accomplish that goal from post 7.<strong> <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-los-alamitos-starlet-stakes.html">READ MORE</a></strong></p>
