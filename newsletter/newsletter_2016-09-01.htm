<p>The Saratoga meet draws to its conclusion at the end of this holiday weekend, but before it will do that, they are offering up some great graded stakes races through Labor Day Monday. Grade 1 Metropolitan Handicap and Whitney hero <stromg>Frosted</stromg> will look add yet another feather in his cap as he maps out his road to the Breeders' Cup this fall, heading a field of nine in the <strong>Grade 1, $600,000 Woodward</strong> on Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>Frosted 1-2</strong> - loves a mile and an eighth.  In five tries at the distance, he has three wins and two seconds to show for it. Kiaran McLaughlin trained colt enters on a nice two race win streak - the Grade 1 Whitney Stakes by an easy two lengths on this track August 6 and by a record-setting 14 1/4 lengths with a 109 BRIS Speed rating in the Grade 1 Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park June 11. He is definitely the one to catch after his ultra-impressive win streak. Joel Rosario has been tabbed to ride the overwhelming morning line favorite from post 3.</p>

<p><strong>American Cleopatra 5-2 </strong> - highly regarded Bob Baffert trained filly <strong>(full sister to American Pharoah)</strong> has just one career start and it was a good one - a 5 1/2 furlong maiden score by two lengths on this track July 31. She steps up hoping to make a major statement Saturday from post 3 with Rafael Bejarano guiding the second betting choice.</p>

<p><strong>Champagne Room 2-1</strong> - has a win and a second place finish in two career starts for trainer Peter Eurton. Last time out was an uber-successful stakes debut - a win by 1 1/4 lengths in the Grade 2 Sorrento Stakes on this very track August 6. Her debut resulted in a second place finish here July 16. Champagne Room is the only stakes winner in the field and hopes to keep an impressive run going from gate 4 Saturday. Mario Gutierrez gets the call on the morning line favorite. </p>

She tries to remain unbeaten Saturday from post 5 with John Velazquez in the irons of this intriguing morning line favorite.</p>
