					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-holy-bull-stakes.html">Holy Bull Stakes</a> at Gulfstream Park</b>: <strong><em> Cairo Prince</em></strong> - has three career starts for trainer Kiaran McLaughlin - two wins and a thrilling second last time out to Honor Code in the Grade 2 Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct November 30. He won the Grade 2 Nashua River Stakes on that same track four weeks earlier and also had a MSW score in his debut at Belmont Park. Cairo Prince is a head away from being undefeated and is one of the favorites for Saturday's race. </p>
					
					<p><strong><em>Mr Speaker</em></strong> - Shug McGaughey trained colt has looked terrific in his last two starts - last time out was a win in the Grade 3 Dania Beach Stakes here on December 21. Before that was a MSW score at Belmont Park in October. He has gotten better every time out and is another one to watch Saturday.  <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-holy-bull-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-forward-gal-stakes.html">Forward Gal Stakes </a> at Gulfstream Park</b>: <strong><em>Resistivity </em></strong>- Mark Casse trained filly races in stakes company for the first time Saturday but is coming off a maiden score on this track December 27. Before that was a second as favorite behind the terrific Unbridled Forever in a MSW at Churchill Downs November 30 and a fifth at Keeneland in her debut in October. Resistivity comes in with arguably the most hype and will have Julien Leparoux, who was aboard her during her only win, in the saddle as she leaves from the rail. A cut back in distance should really help this filly who is expected to do well.
					 </p>	
					 
					 <p><strong><em>Onlyforyou</em></strong> - unbeaten Todd Pletcher trained filly races in stakes company for the first time Saturday after a $75K Allowance Optional Claiming score here December 15 and a MSW score by 3 1/2 lengths in her career bow in October at Aqueduct. She hopes to follow another Todd Pletcher trainee, Kauai Katie in winning the Forward Gal. Javier Castellano gets the call from post 3.  <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-forward-gal-stakes.html">Read More</a>	</p>
					 
					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-sam-houston-race-park-john-b-connally-turf-cup-stakes.html">John B. Connally Turf Cup Stakes</a> at Sam Houston Race Park</b>: <strong><em> Admiral Kitten </em></strong>- Michael Maker trained colt is coming off a good second in the Grade 1 Hollywood Derby December 1 after another second as favorite in the Grade 1 Jamaica Handicap October 5 at Belmont Park. This after his biggest win to date - the Grade 1 Secretariat Stakes at Arlington Park August 17 and a string of another four second place finishes. Included are the Grade 3 American Derby July 13, the Grade 3 Arlington Classic May 25 and the Grade 2 American Turf Stakes also in May. He has placed in nine of 10 career starts all over the country (only once has he been worse than second) and should be competitive as usual Sunday. He is listed as the 2-1 morning line favorite and rightfully so.

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-santa-anita-park-santa-monica-stakes.html">Santa Monica Stakes</a> at Santa Anita Park (Grade 2)</b>: <strong><em>  Teddy's Promise </em></strong>- defending champion in this race by a convincing three lengths, Teddy's Promise finished eighth in the 2012 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint and eighth in the 2013 version of that race. She also won the minor Kalookan Queen Stakes December 29 2012 by 5 1/4 lengths and followed that with a decent second in the Grade 3 Las Flores Stakes at Santa Anita March 10 and a pair of good results in minor stakes starts. Teddy's Promise had a win in the minor L.A. Woman Stakes here October 5 after an OK second in the Grade 2 A Gleam Handicap at Hollywood Park in July and followed that with her disappointing BC bid. Last time out was another minor stakes win - the Playa Del Rey Stakes at Hollywood Park December 15. She ends her career in a race that she loves, looking for her eighth graded stakes score on a track she's won five of 10 starts. Victor Espinoza gets the call from post 2 looking to make Teddy's Promise a $1 million career winner.
