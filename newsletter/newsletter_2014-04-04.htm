					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-aqueduct-racetrack-wood-memorial.html">Wood Memorial 2014 (G1)</a> at Aqueduct, Saturday, April 5 </b>: Undefeated New York-bred Samraat looks to head to the Kentucky Derby with his perfect record intact. He's expected to face untested Social Inclusion, fresh off of a romping Gulfstream Park win, archrival Uncle Sigh, and more at Aqueduct Racetrack on a nationally televised broadcast. The Grade 1, $1 million Wood Memorial offers a total of 170 points, 100 to the winner, on the Road to the Kentucky Derby. The tremendous card also features the <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-aqueduct-racetrack-carter-handicap.html">Grade 1 Carter Handicap</a>, <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-aqueduct-racetrack-gazelle-stakes.html">Grade 2 Gazelle Stakes</a>, and <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-aqueduct-racetrack-bay-shore-stakes.html">Grade 3 Bay Shore</a>.</p> 
					<p><strong><em>
					  Social Inclusion </em></strong> - highly regarded Manuel Azpurua trained colt makes his stakes debut Saturday having won both of his career starts. Last time out was an Allowance score over Remsen winner Honor Code in track record time at Gulfstream March 12 - by 10 lengths after breaking maiden February 22 also on that track. He has the highest Beyer Speed Figure (111) of any 3-year-old racing so far this season. Despite the lack of experience Social Inclusion is the 2-1 morning line favorite for the Wood Memorial. He leaves from the far outside post with Luis Contreras in the saddle. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-aqueduct-racetrack-wood-memorial.html">Read More</a></p>
					<p><strong><em> Samraat </em></strong>- Richard Violette trained New York bred colt will try to remain perfect in his career. He has four starts and four wins - last time out over Uncle Sigh in the Grade 3 Withers Stakes here February 1, before that in his stakes debut - the listed Damon Runyon Stakes by an astounding 16 3/4 lengths here December 18, an Allowance score on this track November 22 and a MSW by 3 1/2 lengths score in his debut at Belmont Park in October. Samraat is the 7-2 second choice on the morning line and will leave from gate 8 with Jose Ortiz aboard.

Last time out Candy Boy took his game to a different level with a terrific win over Chitu (with a 96 Beyer Speed Figure) in the Grade 2 Robert B. Lewis Stakes on this track February 8. He has two wins and two seconds in his last four starts and like California Chrome is peaking at just the right time. He leaves from gate 6 Saturday with the legendary Gary Stevens in the saddle as the 9-5 second choice. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-santa-anita-derby.html">Read More</a></p>
