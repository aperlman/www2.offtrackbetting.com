Plus, Game On Dude looms in the shadows as he looks to go for his third Big 'Cap victory.</p> <p><strong><em>
					 Mucho Macho Man </em></strong> - is coming off a dominant 14 length win in the Florida Sunshine Millions Classic at Gulfstream January 18 after the biggest win of his life - an impressive score over Will Take Charge in the Breeders' Cup Classic and after looking terrific in his previous 11 starts overall as well - five wins, two second, three thirds and 1 unfortunate DNF at last year's Sunshine Million Classic at Gulfstream in January. </p>
					<p><strong><em> Will Take Charge </em></strong> - 2013 Eclipse Award winner for three year old colt was one of the only colts to race all three legs of the Triple Crown finishing eighth in the Kentucky Derby, seventh in the Preakness and tenth in the Belmont. This after an impressive win in the Grade 2 Rebel at Oaklawn Park in March.
