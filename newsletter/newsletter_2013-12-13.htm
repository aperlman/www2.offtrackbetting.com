					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-hollywood-park-cashcall-futurity.html">CashCall Futurity</a> at Hollywood Park (Grade 1)</b>: <strong><em>Tap It Rich</em></strong> - Bob Baffert trainee has two career starts - a MSW 4 1/4 length score at Santa Anita October 12 and a fifth last time out as second choice among bettors in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Despite the lack of action Tap It Rich comes with some hype. He will be out to give his trainer a record sixth CashCall Futurity. Mike Smith will be in the saddle from post 5.</p> 
					<p><em><strong>Tamarando </strong></em> - Jerry Hollendorfer trained colt had three MSW starts to start his career and finally broke maiden on this track August 18 after a second in his second start and a fourth in his debut. He has gone on to win two of four starts - the Grade 1 Del Mar Futurity at 7-1 odds over Dance with Fate September 4 and the 1 1/16 mile, $100,000 Real Quite Stakes by 3 1/4 lengths over Electric Eddie and Karma King last time out on this very track. He also had a pair of thirds sandwiched in there - the Grade 1 FrontRunner Stakes at Santa Anita in September in his first try around two turns and the minor Golden State Juvenile. He will be looking to become only the third horse to win the Real Quiet and the CashCall in the same year had appears to have the form be at least give it a good run. Rafael Bejarano will be aboard from post 2 Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-hollywood-park-cashcall-futurity.html">Read More</a></p>
					
<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-hollywood-park-native-diver-handicap.html">Native Diver Handicap</a> at Hollywood Park (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em>Drill </em></strong> - Bob Baffert trainee has four wins in 20 career starts but those wins are spaced out - no real consistently good results have come from this colt. He won the 2011 Del Mar Futurity and then took six more months before winning the Grade 2 San Vicente in February 2012 and then the Lazaro Barrera in May. He hadn't placed in his first six starts of the year however - five fourth place finishes including four starts in a row (the Grade 2 San Carlos, the Grade 3 San Simeon, the Grade 2 American Handicap and the Grade 1 Triple Bend) before finishing third in his last two starts - the minor Bog Bear Stakes at Santa Anita October 31 and the minor Governor's Cup Handicap in September. Drill is trending upward hoping to give his trainer a second native Diver in a row.

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-hollywood-park-turf-cup.html">Hollywood Turf Cup</a> at Hollywood Park (Grade 2)</b>: <strong><em>Lucayan </em></strong> - French bred colt and Group 1 winner in her native land made his North American debut with a very nice second in the Grade 2 American Handicap May 25 right behind Obviously after eight starts in France produced three wins and two second place finishes including a win at 27-1 odds in the group 1 French 2000 Guineas May 13, 2012 at Longchamp. He had a disappointing ninth last time out in the Grade 1 Pattison International in October after a third in the Grade 2 John Henry Turf Championship September 29, a nice second in the Grade 2 Del Mar Handicap August 25 and a third in an Allowance Optional Claiming August 1. He now has three wins, four seconds and two third place finishes in 14 career starts and will be looking for his first North American win and for a strong rebound after a sub-par outing in Canada last time out. Lucayan looks like the best of an average field for the Hollywood Turf Cup and will have Joel Rosario in the saddle for the first time Saturday.
