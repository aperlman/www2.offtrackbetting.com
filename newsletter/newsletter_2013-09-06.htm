				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-bowling-green-handicap.html">Bowling Green Handicap Contenders at Belmont Park</a> (Grade 2)</b>: <em><strong> <strong>Boisterous:</strong></strong></em> has won seven of his last 14 starts for trainer Shug McGaughey including the 2011 and 2012 Grade 3 Red Smith Stakes at Aqueduct and the 2011 and 2012 Knickerbocker Stakes also at Aqueduct. His worst performance in a year came last time out however - an eighth in the Grade 1 Sword Dancer at Saratoga August 17 after wins in the Grade 2 Monmouth Stakes June 9 and in the Grade 1 Man o' War Stakes July 13 at Belmont Park. Before those wins were second place finishes in the Grade 3 Ben Ali in April and the Grade 3 River City Handicap in November and another couple of wins. He now has four wins and two seconds in his last seven starts overall and will be looking for a bounce back on Saturday. He is most accomplished in the field, will carry the top weight of 122 pounds and will have John Velazquez in the saddle from the rail. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-bowling-green-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
				
				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-delaware-park-kent-stakes.html">Kent Stakes Contenders at Delaware Park</a> (Grade 3)</b>:  <em><strong>Majestic Jess</strong></em> - marked just his third career start on North American soil Saturday after 12 starts in Ireland netted two wins, a second and five third place finishes - respectable indeed. Since shipping he has a fourth in a Claiming in July and a third last time out in a Starter Optional Claiming August 8 - both results at Saratoga. </p> <p><em><strong>Are You Kidding Me</strong></em> - raced to a very good second in the Grade 2 Summer Stakes at Woodbine a year ago for his best career result but has been up and down since. Last time out was a second in the minor Toronto Cup after a fifth in the minor Charlie Barley Stakes and a sixth in the minor Penn Mile in June. His last graded stakes action came in March - a disappointing eighth in the Grade 1 Florida Derby. He has placed in three of six starts in 2013 and enters the Kent in so-so form. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-delaware-park-kent-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-louisiana-downs-super-derby.html">Super Derby Contenders at Louisiana Downs</a> (Grade 2)</b>: <em> <strong>Departing </strong> </em> - sat out the Kentucky Derby but entered the Preakness as one of the hotter entries - he finished sixth in that race but bounced back last time out with a terrific 8 3/4 length win in the Grade 2 West Virginia Derby at Mountaineer August 3. He had five starts prior to the Preakness with four wins including the Grade 3 Illinois Derby April 20 and the minor Texas Heritage Stakes at Sam Houston March 2. His only other career blemish? A third in the Grade 2 Louisiana Derby March 30 at Fair Grounds. He enters as the class of the field having won five of seven career starts with a third place finish and as the even money favorite. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-louisiana-downs-super-derby.html">Read More</a></p>

She has been money in graded stakes races but has certainly been lightly raced the last 10 months. Still, Groupie Doll is the most dangerous entry in the field and the one that everyone has their eyes on ahead of the Masters. She is the 6-5 favorite on the morning line and breaks from post 10 Monday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-presque-isle-downs-masters-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

In 2013 he has raced seven times and finished third in the first four - the Grade 3 Palm Beach Stakes March 3 included and has three straight seconds heading into the BC Derby including the Grade 3 Pegasus at Monmouth in June and the Grade 3 Canadian Derby behind Broadway Empire last time out at Northlands August 17. He hasn't won since his debut in October but has certainly been knocking on the door! <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-hastings-racecourse-british-columbia-derby.html">Read More</a> </p>
