<p>Keeneland celebrates its 80th anniversary of racing when the 2016 Fall Meet gets underway Friday, Oct. 7 with the <strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-keenland-racetrack-darley-alcibiades-stakes.html"> G1 Darley Alcibiades</a></strong>. The 17-day meet opens with Keeneland's prestigious Fall Stars Weekend, when many of racing's most celebrated horses make their final starts before next month's Breeders' Cup World Championships at Santa Anita, and continues the excitement through closing day Oct. 29 with top-quality racing</p>

<p>Keeneland's Fall Meet offers one of the nation's richest purse programs and a convergence of the country's top stables and jockeys. Racing is highlighted by 17 graded stakes worth $5.275 million, six of them Grade 1 races led by the <strong> <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-keeneland-race-course-shadwell-turf-mile.html">$1 million Shadwell Turf Mile (G1)</a></strong> on Oct. 8. Eight Fall Meet stakes are Breeders' Cup Challenge "Win and You're In" races, which award to the winner an automatic berth in the Breeders' Cup World Championships, Nov. 4-5 at Santa Anita Park.</p>

<p>All attention will be focused on Belmont Park and Santa Anita Park as each track hosts major graded races for the Breeders' Cup on a day named Super Saturday. Some of the best horses in the country will be in action this Saturday, and these races will undoubtedly have a large influence on the outcome of the Breeders' Cup.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-belmont-park-jockey-club-gold-cup.html"> G1 Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park</a></strong> - While this year's $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup Stakes (gr. I) lacks superstar power, the field of six older horses is an interesting mix of consistent veterans and less consistent types who have at times flashed talent. <strong>Effinex 7-5 </strong> - last year's Eclipse Award finalist for Older Male and defending third place finisher in this race had eight starts in 2015 for trainer James Jerkins, including four wins...</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2016-los-alamitos-derby.html"> G1 Santa Anita Sprint Championship</a></strong> - The six-furlong race is part of the <strong>Breeders' Cup Win and You're In</strong> program, offering a fees-paid berth for the BC Sprint here on Nov. 5. Lord Nelson, trained by Bob Baffert, earned a position in the BC Sprint with his win in the Grade 1 Bing Crosby Stakes at Del Mar in late July, his most recent start.<p>

<p><strong>Lord Nelson</strong> has won his last three starts, a streak that began with an optional claimer June 3 and continued in the Grade 1 Triple Bend Stakes at seven furlongs here June 25. Owned by Spendthrift Farm, Lord Nelson has won 6 of 12 starts and earned $778,271.</p>
