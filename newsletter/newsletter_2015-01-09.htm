<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-santa-anita-park-sham-stakes.html">Sham Stakes 2015 at Santa Anita</a> - (Grade 3)</b> : The Grade 3 Sham Stakes is on tap for this Saturday, January 10 from Santa Anita in Arcadia, California. A group of three year olds will be after the winner's share of the $100,000 purse and the 10 qualifying points toward this year's Kentucky Derby when they go one mile on Santa Anita's dirt track. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-santa-anita-park-sham-stakes.html">Read More</a> </p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-gulfstream-park-fort-lauderdale-stakes.html">Fort Lauderdale Stakes 2015 at Gulfstream Park</a> - (Grade 2)</b>: <b>Lochte</b> - Marcus Vitali trained gelding made his graded stakes debut one to remember - a win in the Grade 1 Gulfstream Park Turf at 39-1 odds and followed that with a good second in the Grade 1 Frank E. Kilroe Mile at Santa Anita in March and a third in the Grade 1 Maker's 46 Mile in April. He has been up and down since - a disastrous thirteenth in the Grade 2 Monmouth in Stakes in June and an eighth in the Grade 3 Oceanport Stakes in July were the lowest point. He has been OK in his last three starts - a fourth in the Grade 3 Tropical Turf Handicap last time out followed a second in an Allowance and a nice win in the minor The Vid Stakes at Gulfstream September 13. He looks to gain back a little bit of his graded stakes mojo on a track he's recorded four wins and two seconds in six starts. Orlando Bocachica will be in the reins from post 2. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-gulfstream-park-fort-lauderdale-stakes.html">Read More</a> </p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-santa-anita-park-san-pasqual-stakes.html">San Pasqual Stakes 2015 at Santa Anita</a> - (Grade 2)</b>: <b>Hoppertunity</b> - Bob Baffert trained colt was one of the favorites for last year's Kentucky Derby but missed that race. He is coming off a terrific win in the Grade 1 Clark Handicap at Churchill Downs November 28 with an impressive 104 Beyer Speed Figure after a pair of seconds - an Allowance Optional Claiming here in October and behind California Chrome in the Santa Anita Derby in April. That followed a great win over Tapiture in the Grade 2 Rebel Stakes at Oaklawn Park March 15 and a fourth in the Grade 2 Risen Star at Fair Grounds February 22. Hoppertunity has just seven career starts with three wins and two second place finishes - competitive every time out. Martin Garcia will be in charge in Hopportunity's four year old debut looking like the class of the field from post 2 Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-santa-anita-park-san-pasqual-stakes.html">Read More</a> </p>
