                  <p>All eyes are on ORB as we approach the second jewel of the Triple Crown - the Preakness Stakes from Pimlico. The 138th running of the $1,000,000 Preakness Stakes (Grade I), is set for Saturday, May 18, 2013. Orb, who closed from 17th to post a dominating 2 1/2-length victory in the Derby, has won five races in a row, starting with his maiden victory at Aqueduct last November. In his two most recent starts in the Kentucky Derby and the Florida Derby (G1), in particular, Orb was well in command as he crossed the finish line, leading observers to conclude that in each instance he had reserved some energy for his next race.</p>

					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-preakness-stakes-contenders-morning-line.html">2013 Preakness Stakes Contenders & Early Morning Line</a></b>: <strong> - (Grade 1</strong>): The eyes of the horse racing world will be fixated on Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland next week when the best three year olds in the land line up in the second jewel of the Triple Crown - the 2013 Preakness Stakes. The colts cut back in distance slightly for the Preakness - they go 1 3/16 miles instead of the 1 1/4 miles we saw at the Kentucky Derby. Some of the contenders for the Preakness started well in the Derby but faded down the stretch. Does the shorter distance give them an advantage?</p> 
					<p> <strong>Orb 7-5</strong> - A lot of late money came in on Orb at the Kentucky Derby and for good reason. He has now won four straight races - the Kentucky Derby by 2 1/4 lengths, the Grade 1 Florida Derby March 30 at Gulfstream, the Grade 2 Fountain of Youth Stakes February 23 and an Allowance Optional Claiming score January 26. He is the best horse with the best trainer and is in the hands of arguable the best owner for the Preakness. Orb enters with some legitimate swagger! <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-preakness-stakes-contenders-morning-line.html">Read More</a></p>

Last time out was a very impressive win as 2-1 favorite in the Grade 3 Providencia at Santa Anita April 6 after an OK third in the Grade 1 Las Virgenes Stakes March 2, another third in the Grade 3 Santa Ysabel January 16, a second by a nose in the Blue Norther Stakes and a decent third in the Grade 3 Hollywood Starlet December 8. She is the biggest name in the Señorita and is the unquestioned favorite.</p> 
					<p><strong>Sweet Red Cat</strong> - John Sadler pupil had a two race win streak in the winter - a MSW at Hollywood Park December 7 and a Starter Allowance at Santa Anita February 17. She followed that with a second in an Allowance March 21 and was third last time out in her graded stakes debut - the Grade 3 Providencia behind Scarlet Strike April 6 at Santa Anita. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-hollywood-park-senorita-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

His other career result was a second in an Allowance Optional Claiming at Gulfstream February 9. He stretches out to 1 1/8 miles for the first time but is still the morning line favorite for the Peter Pan. </p>
					
					<p><strong>Abraham</strong> - Todd Pletcher pupil had a good third at the Grade 2 Sunland Derby at Sunland Park March 24 after breaking maiden February 16 in his second career start and finishing second in a MSW in his debut. Last time out was a decent fourth in the Grade 3 Illinois Derby at Hawthorne April 20. He figures to be right in the mix Saturday and could help ease Todd Pletcher's Derby hangover. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-peter-pan-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
