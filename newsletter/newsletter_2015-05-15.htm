				  <p><b>Dortmund 7/2 </b> - finished a respectable third last time out in the Kentucky Derby for trainer Bob Baffert - his first loss in seven career starts. He started with six straight victories including the Grade 1 Santa Anita Derby April 4 after a 1 1/4 length gate-to-wire win in the Grade 2 San Felipe Stakes March 7. He has been competitive every time out and will try to get back in the winner's circle Saturday while at the same time ruining his stablemate's aspirations. Martin Garcia will be in the saddle of the morning line second choice from post 2... <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-pimlico-race-course-preakness-stakes.html">Read More</a> </p>

					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-woodbine-racetrack-marine-stakes.html">Marine Stakes 2015 at Woodbine Racetrack</a></b>: <strong>(Grade 3)</strong>: <em><strong>Ami's Flatter</strong></em>  - one of the Queen's Plate favorites will hit the track for the fifth time for trainer Josie Carroll having recorded a win and two seconds so far. Last time out was one of those seconds - in the Grade 2 Tampa Bay Derby March 7 which followed a close fourth in the competitive Sam F. Davis Stakes here and a good second in his stakes debut - behind Bluegrass Singer in the minor Mucho Macho Man Stakes at Gulfstream Park January 3. He departs from the rail Saturday with Luis Contreras aboard looking like one of the horses to beat. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-woodbine-racetrack-marine-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

Last time out was a good win by 5 1/4 lengths in the Grade 2 Distaff Handicap (for the second straight year) at Aqueduct April 18 which followed a disappointing seventh in the Grade 3 Fall Highweight Handicap in November, a win in the minor Iroquois Stakes October 18 and a good second in the Grade 2 Gallant Bloom Handicap September 20. She also had a four race win streak at this time last year - the minor Dancin Renee Stakes July 3, the minor Critical Eye Stakes May 31, the 2014 Distaff Handicap and the minor Broadway Stakes in March. She had a five race win streak earlier in her career as well. La Verdad has been as competitive as they come but has delivered the occasional dud as well. Jose Ortiz will be in the saddle of the 121 pound highweight from the rail. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-belmont-park-vagrancy-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>

He had four wins and a third place finish in eight starts last year - five wins, a second and two thirds in 13 career starts. Before the Mathis Brothers was a nice three race win streak - the Grade 3 Commonwealth Turf Stakes at Churchill Downs November 15, the Grade 3 Jefferson Cup Stakes on that same track in September and the minor Better Talk Now Stake in wire-to-wire fashion at Saratoga in August. Heart to Heart looks to get back to his winning ways when he leaves from gate 6 with Paco Lopez aboard the probable morning line favorite. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2015-monmouth-park-red-bank-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
