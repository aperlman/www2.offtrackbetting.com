 <p>All eyes are on <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-preakness-stakes-california-chrome-arrives-pimlico.html">the favorite California Chrome</a> as we approach the second jewel of the Triple Crown - the Preakness Stakes from Pimlico. The 139th running of the $1,000,000 Preakness Stakes (Grade I), is set for Saturday, May 17, 2014. </p>					

<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-pimlico-black-eyed-susan-stakes.html">Black-Eyed Susan Stakes Preview</a></b>: <strong> - Pimlico (Grade 2</strong>): <em><strong> Stopchargingmaria</strong></em> - Todd Pletcher trained filly is coming off fourth in the Grade 3 Fantasy Stakes at Oaklawn Park April 5 after a career worst performance - a fifth in the Grade 2 Davona Dale Stakes February 22, a terrific win in the Grade 2 Demoiselle Stakes at Aqueduct November 30, an equally impressive win by 10 3/4 lengths in the Grade 3 Tempted Stakes November 3, a third in the Grade 1 Frizette and a second in the Grade 1 Spinaway and a MSW score in her debut. She has three wins, a second and a third place finish in seven career starts but seems to be regressing after a promising start to her career. Javier Castellano will be in the saddle aboard the 122-pound highweight and the early 7-2 morning line favorite from post 4.

					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-pimlico-special-stakes.html">Pimlico Special Preview</a> - Pimlico (Grade 3)</b>: <strong>Revolutionary</strong> - Todd Pletcher trained colt entered last year`s Kentucky Derby on a three race win streak - a terrific score in the Grade 2 Louisiana Derby March 30, a win in the Grade 3 Withers Stakes at Aqueduct February 2 and an 8 1/2 length win over Transparent at Aqueduct December 28, 2012 over 1 mile. He put up a fight in the Derby and finished an OK third and skipped the Preakness and went on to a fifth in the Belmont Stakes in June. He has just three starts since the Triple Crown - an Allowance Optional Claiming score January 11, a disappointing seventh in the Grade 1 Donn Handicap in February and a good second last time out to Will Take Charge in the Grade 2 Oaklawn Handicap April 12. Mike Smith gets the call Friday on the 5-2 morning line favorite from post 6. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-pimlico-special-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
