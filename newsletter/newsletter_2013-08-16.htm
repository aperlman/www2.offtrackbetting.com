				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-alabama-stakes.html">Alabama Stakes at Saratoga Race Course</a> (Grade 1)</b>: <em><strong>Princess Of Sylmar goes up against Fiftyshadesofhay</strong></em> - Todd Pletcher pupil has won six of her last seven starts (four of five this year) - a second in the Grade 2 Gazelle Stakes to Close Hatches at Aqueduct April 6 being the only blemish in the last 10 months. The wins include the Grade 1 American Oaks last time out July 20 at Saratoga, the Grade 1 Kentucky Oaks at 38-1 odds over Dreaming of Julia, the minor Busher Stakes at Aqueduct February 2 to follow another win at Aqueduct - the Busanda Stakes by 7 1/2 lengths January 4. She also has a MSW and an Allowance Optional Claiming score. She is absolutely on fire and has two straight Grade 1 wins under her belt ahead of this weekend. She likely need just this win to secure the Eclipse Award and obviously is the one to beat! She breaks from post 4 with Javier Castellano in the saddle. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-alabama-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
				
				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-sword-dancer-invitational-stakes.html">Sword Dancer Invitational Stakes at Saratoga Race Course</a> (Grade 1)</b>:  <em>The Sword Dancer has attracted a large field of 13 for race 9 on Saratoga's Saturday card. Post time is 5:12 PM. Let's take a look into the past performances of all 13 combatants for this lucrative Grade 1 stakes. <em><strong>Boisterous</strong></em> - has won seven of his last 13 starts for trainer Shug McGaughey including the 2011 and 2012 Grade 3 Red Smith Stakes at Aqueduct and the 2011 and 2012 Knickerbocker Stakes also at Aqueduct. His lone poor performance the last couple years came in August 2012 - a ninth in the Grade 1 Arlington Millions but he won two straight after that. He had a pair of good seconds recently - in the Grade 3 Ben Ali Stakes last time out at Keeneland April 21 after the Grade 3 River City Handicap at Churchill Downs November 5 but has taken his game to another level in his last two starts - wins in the Grade 2 Monmouth Stakes June 9 and in the Grade 1 Man o' War Stakes July 13 at Belmont Park. He now has four wins and two seconds in his last six starts overall and is obviously in the best form of his career. Boisterous is on fire, will have John Velazquez in the saddle, breaks from post 11, is the 123 pound co-highweight and is the horse to beat at 5-2 odds Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-sword-dancer-invitational-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

She also had a win in an Allowance Optional Claiming at Arlington Park June 23 after a second in an Allowance in May. Other notable career results include a second in the minor Surfer Girl Stakes at Santa Anita in October after an eighth in the Oak Tree Juvenile Fillies Turf in September.
