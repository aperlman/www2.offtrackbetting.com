The wins include the Grade 1 Kentucky Oaks last time out at 38-1 odds over Dreaming of Julia, the minor Busher Stakes at Aqueduct February 2 to follow another win at Aqueduct - the Busanda Stakes by 7 1/2 lengths January 4. She also has a MSW and an Allowance Optional Claiming score. She has emerged on the radar and is the name to watch Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-saratoga-race-course-coaching-club-american-oaks.html">Read More</a></p>

She went on to a fifth in the Grade 2 Top Flight Handicap in March and a disappointing eighth as 2-1 favorite in the Grade 3 Whimsical Stakes on this track in April but bounced back last time out with a nice 8 1/2 length win in the minor Trillium Stakes on this track June 8. She won her first stakes races last time out and looks good to record her first graded stakes score Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-woodbine-racetrack-ontario-matron-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

Before the trip she had three straight wins including the Grade 3 Sabin Stakes at Gulfstream, a repeat win in the Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic and a win in the Grade 1 Beldame at Belmont Park September 29. Last time out she was a decent second in the Grade 2 Fleur de Lis Handicap at Churchill Downs. She won this race last year over Tiz Miz Sue who has opted to skip the Del Cap and has three wins and a pair of seconds in six starts since. She is the highweight and the favorite for Saturday's race and she will have the extra motivation of rebounding from an ugly and uncharacteristic fifth last time out. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-delaware-park-delaware-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
