					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-hawthorne-derby.html">HAWTHORNE DERBY</a> at Hawthorne Park (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em>All Squared Away</em></strong> - had a very impressive win in the Grade 3 Lexington Stakes on April 21 at Hawthorne Park to follow up a sixth in the Grade 3 Spiral Stakes at Turfway in March. Since then All Squared Away has posted a pair of fifths - at the Marine Stakes May 12 and an Allowance Optional Claiming July 21 and a disappointing seventh in the Grade 2 Swaps Stakes.</p> 
					<p><em><strong>Quick Wit </strong></em>- finished an impressive third at the Grade 2 Hutcheson Stakes on February 11 at Gulfstream after winning a Maiden Special Weight race at Gulfstream on January 28. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-hawthorne-derby.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-keeneland-queen-elizabeth-stakes.html">QUUEN ELIZABETH II CHALLENGE CUP STAKES</a> at Keeneland (Grade 1)</b>:  <strong><em>Samitar</em></strong> - Irish filly Samitar makes her third start on North American soil after a decent career in her native land on Saturday. She finished a good third place finish in her debut at the Grade 2 Lake George Stakes at Saratoga on July 25 and followed that with an impressive score last time out in the Grade 1 Garden City Stakes here on September 15.</p>
					<p><strong><em>Stephanie's Kitten</em></strong> - had a very productive Juvenile campaign in which she won or placed in all five starts (three wins and two third place finishes). Among Stephanie's Kitten's impressive wins is the Grade 2 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf on November 4 and before that the Grade 1 Darley Alcibiades Stakes in October. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-keeneland-queen-elizabeth-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>

                    <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-belmont-park-knickerbocker-stakes.html">KNICKERBOCKER STAKES</a> at Belmont Park (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em>Boisterous</em></strong> - is the defending champion in this race and had been very good as of late with three wins in five starts between October and May - wins at the Grade 3 Fort Macy Stakes, at the Grade 2 Red Smith Handicap in November and the Knickerbocker Stakes here last October. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-belmont-park-knickerbocker-stakes.html">Read More</a></p> 				

                    <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-belmont-park-foxwoods-champagne-stakes.html">FOXWOODS CHAMPAGNE STAKES</a> at Belmont Park (Grade 1)</b>: <strong><em>Archwarrior</em></strong> - is one of three Todd Pletcher colts entered in the Champagne and has a ton of hype behind him. He has only one start but it was an impressive one - a Maiden Special Weight score by 3 3/4 lengths at Saratoga August 30.</p> 
                    <p><strong><em>Shanghai Bobby</em></strong> - has three career stars and three wins for trainer Todd Pletcher. Last time out was an impressive 3 3/4 length score in the Grade 2 Three Chimneys Hopeful Stakes to follow a maiden win on April 19 at Aqueduct and an impressive win in the Track Barron Stakes at Belmont Park on June 27. Shanghai Bobby looks good and should be in contention Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-belmont-park-foxwoods-champagne-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-woodbine-pattison-canadian-international-stakes.html">PATTISON CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL STAKES</a> at Woodbine (Grade 1)</b>: <strong><em>Imperial Monarch</em></strong> - Irish bred filly has only four career starts - all overseas. Those starts produced three wins and one eighth place finish two back. He is lightly raced and is coming off an impressive Group 1 Stakes score in Europe. He comes into the Canadian International with a ton of hype and a ton of speed! </p> 
                    <p><strong><em>Reliable Man</em></strong> - British bred colt has 11 career starts with four wins, a second and two third place finishes. Last time out was a good second in a Group 3 Stakes - the only time he has placed in his last four starts. He won four of his first five career starts and dominated in France for the first 3/4 of 2011. Now the trick is to get back into the top notch form that race fans in Europe became accustomed to. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-woodbine-pattison-canadian-international-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-woodbine-ep-taylor-stakes.html">E.P. TAYLOR STAKES</a> at Woodbine (Grade 1)</b>: <strong><em>Siyouma</em></strong> - is a Group 1 winner at Newmarket last month and has one win at this distance in her 9 race career. In seven starts this year Siyouma has two wins and three third place finishes but her win last time is enough to have made her the morning line favorite for the E.P. Taylor. </p> 
                    <p><strong><em>Dream Peace</em></strong> - has raced all around the world with mixed results - four wins, two seconds and four third place finishes in 14 career starts. Last time out was a decent third in the Grade 1 Flower Bowl Invitational to follow a very good second in the Grade 1 Diana Stakes at Saratoga July 28 and a pair of pedestrian results overseas. Dream Peace also had a third as 2-1 favorite in last year's E.P. Taylor Stakes to prove that she will not be out of her league in this one. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-woodbine-ep-taylor-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
