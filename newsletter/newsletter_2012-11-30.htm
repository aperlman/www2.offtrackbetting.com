<p>At OffTrackBetting.com, we believe we've raised the bar to a new height when it comes to <strong>Player Rewards</strong>. We looked at some of our competitors reward programs and were confused - so many rules, exceptions and minimum thresholds to meet.</p> 
<p>Deciding which online Racebook gives you the greatest betting advantage comes down to simple arithmetic. For every $1,000 wagered, you can <strong>earn  cash rewards up to $120</strong> at OTB. That same $1,000 at another ADW  would get you at best $30, and that is only if you bet on specific "bonus tracks." <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse-racing-rewards.html"><strong>See Player Rewards Comparison</strong></a></p>

					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/kentucky-derby-new-point-system.html">2013 KENTUCKY DERBY NEW POINT SYSTEM</a></b>: <strong><em>The "New" Road to the Kentucky Derby - What It All Means</em></strong> -  In what has been one of the most significant moves in Horse Racing's biggest race in 25 years, Churchill Downs has changed the criteria for qualifying for the Biggest of Them All - The Kentucky Derby, the 1 1/4 mile classic on the first Saturday in May. The reason for the changes? To simplify the qualification process and to make it easier for Horse Racing's ever-evolving fan base to understand how a horse qualifies. </p> 
					<p> A "Road to the Kentucky Derby" point system was created to establish a clear, practical and understandable path to the first leg of horse racing's Triple Crown. Previously the approximately 185 graded stakes races worldwide - including 60 open races and another 43 races restricted to fillies in North America - all counted toward the Derby selection under the previous eligibility process.  <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/kentucky-derby-new-point-system.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-hollywood-park-native-diver-handicap.html">NATIVE DIVER HANDICAP</a> at Hollywood Park (Grade 3)</b>: <strong><em>Game on Dude</em></strong> -  is a multiple Grade 1 winner that is in the thick of the Horse of the Year conversation. He rebounded very nicely from a disappointing twelfth in the Dubai World Cup with a terrific win in the Grade 2 Californian Stakes on June 2 over Kettle Corn and then followed it up with another impressive score in the Grade 1 Hollywood Gold Cup July 7. He was a decent second in the Grade 1 Pacific Stakes and again proved his worth with a win in the Grade 1 Awesome Again here September 29. Last time out however was his most disappointing result in some time - a well beaten seventh as 6-5 favorite in the Breeders' Cup Classic. </p> 
					<p><em><strong>Richard's Kid</strong></em> - was an OK third in the Grade 1 Awesome Again behind Game on Dude after another third in the Grade 1 Pacific Classic right behind Game on Dude again. He had a win before that in the Grade 3 Cougar II Handicap on July 27 to follow another second to Game On Dude in the Hollywood Gold Cup and a win in the minor Prove It Stakes. Last time out was a fifth ahead of Game On Dude in the Breeders' Cup Classic. Richard's Kid had placed in five straight races before the Breeders' including two wins and appears in good form ahead of this latest showdown with Game on Dude. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-hollywood-park-native-diver-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-hollywood-park-vernon-underwood-stakes.html">VERNON O. HANDICAP</a> at Hollywood Park (Grade 3)</b>:  <strong><em> Comma to the Top</em></strong> - Grade 1 winner and Peter Miller trained gelding has won two of his last four starts and has three wins and a third in six starts this year. The wins include an Allowance score at Golden Gate on June 9, the minor Pirate's Bounty Stakes at Del Mar September 5 and the Big Bear Handicap last time out at Santa Anita October 21. He finished nineteenth in last year's Kentucky Derby, was sixth in the Grade 2 Sir Beaufort in December and was third in the Robert K Kerlan Memorial Handicap July 1 to name a few of his stakes results. He was fourth in the Grade 1 Bing Crosby and fourth in the Grade 3 Eddie D Stakes two back but has wins sandwiched around his most recent fourth. He is one contender that didn't race in the Breeders' Cup Sprint but still comes in as one to watch Sunday - he did have three stakes wins during a six week span on this track in 2010.</p>
					<p><strong><em>Smiling Tiger</em></strong> - multiple graded stakes winner finished third in the Breeders' Cup Sprint last time out at 20-1 odds by three lengths. In four starts this year Smiling Tiger has just one other third place finish - at the Grade 2 True North Handicap June 9. That makes two thirds and two fifth place finishes in four starts this year but a third at the BC Sprint has Smiling Tiger on the radar for the Underwood. Three wins in four starts on this track and a penchant for winning big races helps as well! <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2012-hollywood-park-vernon-underwood-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
