					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-gulfstream-park-pan-american-stakes.html">2013 Pan American Stakes at Gulfstream Park</a></b>: <strong> - (Grade 2</strong>): <strong>Teaks North</strong> - came out of nowhere two back and won the Sunshine Millions Turf Stakes at Gulfstream in wire-to-wire fashion January 19 and followed that with another good result last time out - a second in the Grade 2 Mac Diarmida here February 16. This after a tenth in the El Prado Stakes and a fifth in last year's Sunshine Millions Turf Stakes. He was terrific in the summer of 2011 with 2 graded stakes wins but outside of last two results - he hasn't been great. He has been injury prone in the past but when running right is a serious threat.</p> 
					<p> <strong>Ioya Bigtime</strong> - started 2012 off slowly but enters the Pan American having placed in five of his last six starts - a win in the Grade 3 Stars and Stripes Stakes at Arlington Park on July 14, a second in the American St. Leger Stakes in August, a win at the Grade 3 Kentucky Turf Cup September 14, a second in the Grade 2 Sycamore Stakes at Keeneland in October and an OK third last time out in the Mac Diarmida behind Teaks North and Amira's Prince. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-gulfstream-park-pan-american-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-park-tokyo-city-cup.html">Tokyo City Cup at Santa Anita Park</a>  (Grade 3)</b>: <strong>Calidoscopio</strong> - Argentinean entry hasn`t raced since a terrific upset win in the Breeders' Cup Marathon in November after five months off and a win in the Grade 2 General Belgrano in Argentina. Before that was a ninth in a Grade 1 race in his native land and a win in February also in Argentina. He has won two huge races in a row despite long layoffs in between and has to be on the Tokyo City radar.</p> 
					<p><strong>Dhaamer</strong> - enters the Tokyo City Cup after a nearly seven month layoff. Before that was a good second in the Grade 2 Del Mar Handicap behind Casino Host in August and a two race win streak - the Round Table Stakes on May 13 by four and a half lengths and an impressive win in the Grade 3 Sunset Handicap in July. He finished second in this race last year behind Dynamic Host and hopes are that the layoff wasn't a deal breaker for this year's Tokyo City. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-park-tokyo-city-cup.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-park-santa-ana-stakes.html">Santa Ana Stakes at Santa Anita Park</a> (Grade 2)</b>:  <strong>Lady of Shamrock</strong> - is a four time stakes winner who was fifth last time out in the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf in November. She finished a close second in the Honeymoon Handicap on June 9 to My Gi Gi and then bounced back with a terrific wins in the Grade 1 American Oaks July 14 and the Grade 1 Del Mar Oaks August 18. Her other wins last year include the Grade 3 Providencia Stakes at Santa Anita on April 7 and the China Doll Stakes. She has won four of her last six - all stakes races but she hasn't seen action since the Breeders' Cup - her worst effort since her racing debut in September 2011. She races for the first time for new trainer John Sadler but will have regular jockey Mike Smith in the saddle having won three of four starts on this track</p>
					<p><strong>Quiet Oasis</strong> - made her 2012 debut with an impressive win in the Grade 3 Wilshire Handicap at Hollywood Park on April 29 and followed it up with a very good result - a second in the Grade 1 Gamely Stakes also on that track. Her last action was way back in July - another impressive score in the Grade 2 Royal Heroine Mile also at Hollywood Park. She has been out of action for eight months but has two wins and a second - all in graded stakes action in her last three starts. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-park-santa-ana-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
