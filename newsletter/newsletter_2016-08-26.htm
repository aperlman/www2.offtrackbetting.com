<p>The main event on a busy weekend of graded stakes action - the Grade 1 Travers Stakes comes our way from Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York. Some of the best three year olds in the land will chase the winner's share of the $1.25 million purse when they take to Saratoga's dirt track and race 1 1/4 miles.</p>

<p>Headed by the 1-2 finishers in the Belmont Stakes - Big Chief Racing's Preakness and Haskell Invitational winner <strong>Exaggerator</strong>, and WinStar Farm & Bobby Flay's <strong>Creator</strong> and Twin Creeks Racing Stables & Eclipse Thoroughbred Partner's <strong>Destin</strong> -  the diverse lineup includes three other Kentucky Derby starters, several graded stakes winners, and a handful of up-and-comers getting good at the right time. Notably among the late bloomers are Baffert's two California invaders, Gary and Mary West's American Freedom, and Juddmonte Farms' Arrogate.</p>
