Three year old Derby hopefuls will take to Keeneland's dirt track and race 1 1/16 miles looking for the winner's share of the $200,000 purse and the all-important 10 qualifying points toward the Kentucky Derby May 3. </p> 
					<p><strong><em>
					  Divine Oath </em></strong>  - Todd Pletcher trained colt has just two career starts with two wins - an Allowance Optional Claiming and a MSW - both at Gulfstream. He sat out of the Blue Grass Stakes in favor of making his stakes debut this weekend and is expected to be the one to beat. Javier Castellano gets the call from post 6 Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-keeneland-race-course-lexington-stakes.htmll">Read More</a></p>
					<p><strong><em> Mr Speaker </em></strong> - Shug McGaughey trained colt has looked terrific at the end of 2013 - an impressive 10 3/4 length win in the Grade 3 Dania Beach Stakes here on December 21 and a MSW score at Belmont Park in October. Last time out was a good second in the Grade 3 Palm Beach Stakes at Gulfstream March 1 after a step backward - a disappointing seventh in the Grade 2 Holy Bull Stakes here January 25 in his first start on dirt. Mr Speaker has two wins and a second in his last four starts overall and is one to keep an eye on this weekend in his Polytrack debut. He leaves from the rail with Jose Lezcano aboard.

					  <p><strong><em>Class Leader</em></strong> - has just three career starts for trainer Neil Howard and enters on a two race win streak - both at Fair Grounds. Last time out was an Allowance Optional Claiming score March 13 after breaking maiden February 17. He starts from the outside post in his stakes debut looking to continue the momentum and looking like Midnight Hawk's biggest threat.

					 <p><strong><em>Moreno</em></strong>  - was last seen running a disappointing tenth in the Breeders' Cup. The Eric Guillot pupil raced to a seventh in the Grade 2 Best Pal Stakes in August 2012 in his second career start and concentrated on MSW races in his next eight starts. His only win in those races came by 6 1/4 lengths at Belmont Park June 8. Recently he stepped back into graded stakes company and he won the Grade 2 Dwyer Stakes in impressive fashion by seven lengths July 6 and followed that with ... <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-charles-town-classic.html">Read More</a></p>
