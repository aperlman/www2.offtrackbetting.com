He hasn't been touched in his three starts and is the morning line favorite Saturday.</p> 
					<p> <strong>Vyjack</strong> - has four career starts but has won all on this track - a Maiden Special Weight in his career debut November, the Traskwood Stakes December 9, the Grade 2 Jerome Stakes over Siete de Oros January 5 and last time out in the Grade 3 Gotham Stakes March 2. Trainer Rudy Rodriguez has a real Derby contender on his hands - it will be interesting to see if Vyjack can keep his roll going Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-aqueduct-wood-memorial-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-keeneland-race-course-ashland-stakes.html">Ashland Stakes at Keeneland Race Course</a>  (Grade 1)</b>: <strong>Spring in the Air</strong> - She put her name on the map with a very good second in the Grade 2 Natalma Stakes at Woodbine September 15 and followed that with a very impressive score in the Grade 1 Darley Alcibiades October 5. Next up was the Breeders' Cup Fillies where Spring in the Air finished an OK fifth. After a four month layoff she returned March 11 to the OBS Championship (Filly Division) at Ocala Training Center where she finished second to Spring Venture. She is the only Grade 1 winner in the field and is likely the favorite Saturday.</p> 
					<p><strong>Spring Venture</strong> - won her first three career start for trainer Mark Casse including was a nice win in the Grade 3 Mazarine Stakes October 6 to follow a win in the Grade 2 Natalma Stakes over Spring in the Air September 15 and a maiden score August 18 - all at Woodbine. She had a disappointing thirteenth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf for her worst career result and followed that with a pedestrian fifth in the Grade 2 Forward Gal Stakes January 26. Last time out was a bounce back effort - a win in the OBS Championship (Filly Division) Stakes at Ocala Training Center March 11 over Spring in the Air. She in one of three graded stake winners in the field and should contend Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-keeneland-race-course-ashland-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
