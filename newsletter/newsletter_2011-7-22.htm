                    <span>At OffTrackBetting.com, we believe we've raised the bar to a new height when it comes to player rewards. All members are automatically enrolled to receive Daily Rebates based on the previous days activity that earns you cash back on every wager you make, win or lose.

                    Your account gives you  rebates on wagers from nearly every track we offer - up to 12%. Other websites offer one-time signup bonuses and Reward Point Systems, but these offers require a substantial effort to redeem -- you have to wager up to 5x the bonus offer at some sites.<br>
                    <br>
