					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-gulfstream-park-handicap.html">2013 Gulfstream Park Handicap</a></b>: (<strong>Grade 2</strong>): <strong>Fort Larned</strong> - looked very good at the start of 2012 with wins in the Challenger Stakes and the Grade 3 Skip Away Stakes at Gulfstream but had a disappointing eighth at the Grade 1 Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs June 16 for his worst result of last year. He won the Grade 3 Cornhusker Handicap and followed that with another terrific result - a win in the Grade 1 Whitney Invitational. He had a decent third in the Grade 3 Jockey Club Gold Cup in September but he really shone last time out - a terrific win in the Breeders' Cup Classic. He has win three of his last four starts - all graded stakes races and is the one to watch Saturday.</p> 
					<p> <strong>Fort Loudon</strong> - has placed in five of six races since August and is coming off a very good win in the Grade 3 Gulfstream Park Sprint Championship Stakes February 9. Before that was a third in the Sunshine Millions Classic, a second in the Sunshine Stake Stakes and a good second in the Grade 3 Ack Ack Stakes at Churchill Downs November 2. Fort Loudon has been in every race the last six months and could be a factor. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-gulfstream-park-handicap.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-park-san-felipe-stakes.html">San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita Park</a>  (Grade 2)</b>: <strong>Flashback</strong> - Bob Baffert colt has been impressive in two career starts - a Maiden Special Weight score by 3 1/2 lengths as favorite at Hollywood Park December 8 was followed by a terrific win in the Grade 2 Robert B. Lewis February 2 by 6 1/4 lengths on this track. The word is out on Flashback.</p> 
					<p><strong>Goldencents</strong> - has four career starts - the first was a Maiden Special Weight score by 7 1/4 lengths at Del Mar September 2 and the second was a second place finish to highly touted Shanghai Bobby in the Grade 1 Foxwoods Champaign at Belmont Park October 6. He is coming off an impressive victory in the Grade 3 Sham Stakes over Den's Legacy here January 5 after another win in the $1 million Grade 3 Delta Downs Jackpot over Bern Identity November 17 at Delta Downs in gate-to-wire fashion. Trainer Doug O'Neil certainly has a Derby contender in Goldencents - a win here would go a long way in proving this point. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-santa-anita-park-san-felipe-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-tampa-bay-downs-derby.html">2013 Tampa Bay Downs Derby</a> (Grade 2)</b>:  <strong>Verrazano</strong> - Todd Pletcher trained colt makes his stakes debut after two starts and two wins - an impressive Allowance Optional Claiming last time out by 16 3/4 lengths at Gulfstream February 2 with a Beyer Speed figure of 105 and a MSW score by 7 3/4 lengths in his debut January 1 also at Gulfstream. He hasn't been touched in his two starts and is likely the favorite Saturday.</p>
					<p><strong>Falling Sky</strong> - has four career starts and three wins - a 1 3/4 length score in a 6 1/2 furlong Allowance Optional Claiming December 14 in which he earned an 89 Beyer Speed figure, a MSW score in his debut November 1 at Calder and last time out in the Grade 3 Sam F. Davis Stakes at Tampa Bay Downs in gate-to-wire fashion February 2. Sandwiched in there is a fourth in his only other stakes race - the minor Inaugural Stakes here December 1. Falling Sky, off his first graded stakes win is an intriguing entry for the Tampa Bay Derby - he should contend Saturday. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-tampa-bay-downs-derby.html">Read More</a></p>
