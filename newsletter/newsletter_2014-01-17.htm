					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-sunshine-millions-classic.html">Sunshine Millions Classic</a> at Gulfstream Park</b>: <strong><em>Mucho Macho Man</em></strong>  - is coming off the biggest win of his life - an impressive score in the Breeders' Cup Classic after looking terrific in his previous 11 starts overall as well - five wins, two second, three thirds and 1 unfortunate DNF at last year's Sunshine Million Classic at Gulfstream in January. He had a win in the Grade 1 Awesome Again Stakes here September 28 after a good third in the Grade 1 Whitney Invitational at Saratoga August 3 and a third in the minor Criminal Type Stakes at Belmont Park in June. He also had a good second to Fort Larned in the 2012 Breeders' Cup Classic. Mucho Macho Man had only five starts last year for trainer Katherine Rivto and will be out to avenge his one poor result. Mucho Macho Man has eight wins, five seconds and six third place finishes in 23 career starts and has been at or near the top in every race the last two years - except this one last year! He won this race in 2012 and is the overwhelming favorite Saturday to not only finish, but win the Sunshine Millions Classic for the second time in three years. Legend Gary Stevens will get the call from post 4.  <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-sunshine-millions-classic.html">Read More</a></p>
					
<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-sunshine-millions-distaff.html">Sunshine Millions Distaff </a> at Gulfstream Park</b>: <strong><em>Toasting</em></strong> - started her career with three straight MSW races with a win in the third. She was a very nice third in the Grade 1 Frizette Stakes behind Dreaming of Julia at Belmont Park in October 2012 but was fifth in the Joe O'Farrell Juvenile Fillies Stakes at Calder November 10. Last year she had an Allowance Optional Claiming score at Gulfstream February 15, a third in the OBS Championship (Filly Division) Stakes at Ocala Training Center March 11 and was third again in the Grade 2 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes behind Marathon Lady May 17. She finished fourth in the Grade 1 Mother Goose and won the Dream Rush Stakes at Belmont Park October 20. Last time out Toasting was a good second in the Grade 3 Comely Stakes at Aqueduct November 30, missing by a head. She has three wins, two seconds and four thirds in 13 career starts. Toasting is the 9-5 morning line favorite and will have Jose Ortiz aboard from post 2.

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-gulfstream-park-sunshine-millions-day.html">Sunshine Millions Filly & Mare Sprint</a> at Gulfstream Park</b>: <strong><em>R Free Roll</em></strong> - is the 5-2 morning line favorite and rightfully so. She is coming off a second in the Grade 3 Sugar Swirl on this track December 14 after a win in the Bold World Handicap in November and a second in the Charles Town Oaks in September. She has two wins and three seconds in her last six starts overall and is expected to be the one to beat Saturday.</p>	
					 
					 <p><em><strong>Sweet N Discreet</strong></em> - Todd Pletcher trained filly has looked very good as of late - two wins and two seconds in her last four starts. Last time out was a second to Devil's Cave in the Ocala Stakes on this track December 29 after two Allowance Optional Claiming scores here earlier this winter. She has three wins, three seconds and two third place finishes in her 10 career starts and is an interesting name to watch. She is cross-entered in the Distaff but if she runs the F & M Sprint she will be another one to watch at 4-1 odds.

					 <p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2014-santa-anita-park-la-canada-stakes.html">La Canada Stakes</a> at Santa Anita Park (Grade 2)</b>: <strong><em> Fiftyshadesofhay </em></strong> - Bob Baffert trained filly has 13 career starts. She had a very nice second behind Beholder in the Grade 1 Las Virgenes Stakes March 2 and she won the Grade 3 Santa Ysabel by 5 3/4 lengths last January 26 on this track in her graded stakes debut with an impressive Beyer speed figure of 90. She was third in the Grade 1 Santa Anita Oaks April 6 also behind Beholder and had a nice two race win streak last year - the Grade 2 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes at Pimlico May 17 and in the Grade 3 Iowa Oaks June 29 and has looked good in three starts since. Last time out was second as even-money favorite in the Grade 2 Bayakoa at Hollywood Park December 7 after a third in the Grade 2 Indiana Oaks and a second in the Grade 1 Alabama Stakes in August. She has placed in her last eight graded stakes starts - no reason to think differently about this weekend. A little added motivation in the form of Broken Sword who beat her last time out should help Fiftyshadesofhay rebound. Mike Smith has the mount.
