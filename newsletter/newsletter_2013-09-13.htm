				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-garden-city-stakes.html">Garden City Stakes 2013 Contenders at Belmont Park</a> (Grade 1)</b>: <em><strong> <strong>Emollient</strong></strong></em>  - Bill Mott trained Emollient has eight career starts with four wins and two second place finishes. She had a fifth in the Grade 2 Gulfstream Oaks behind Dreaming of Julia March 30 but bounced back in a big way with a terrific nine length win in the Grade 1 Ashland Stakes at Keeneland at 6-1 odds April 6. She followed that with a sixth as 4-5 favorite in the Grade 2 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes after stumbling at the start at Pimlico May 17 and a terrific win last time out in the Grade 1 American Oaks July 13 in her only career start on grass. She has won every second start in her last five overall but in between wins has been some uncharacteristically poor results. If the pattern holds true Emollient is in for a tough race - hopes are she breaks the trend. Emollient is the 3-1 favorite Saturday and departs from the rail with Mike Smith in the saddle. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-garden-city-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
				
				<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-noble-damsel-stakes.html">Noble Damsel Stakes 2013 Contenders at Belmont Park</a> (Grade 3)</b>:  <em><strong>Better Lucky </strong></em> - won the Grade 1 Matriarch at 35-1 odds to conclude her 2012 campaign and was an OK third in her first start of 2013 - in the Grade 1 Jenny Wiley Stakes behind Centre Court among others at Keeneland April 13. Last time out she continued to look good - a second to Stephanie's Kitten in the Grade 1 Just a Game Stakes on this track in June. She has placed in four straight starts - all Grade 1 stakes. If there is one thing we know about Better Lucky it is that she will be competitive each and every time out. She is the 9-5 favorite on the morning line and rightfully so, she carries the top weight of 123 pounds and she departs from post 3 with Javier Castellano aboard. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-belmont-park-noble-damsel-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
					
					<p><b><a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-woodbine-racetrack-woodbine-mile.html">Woodbine Mile 2013 Contenders at Woodbine Racetrack</a> (Grade 1)</b>: <em> <strong>Wise Dan</strong> </em> - How good was Wise Dan in 2012? He is the only horse since 1981 to win three Eclipse Awards in one night. He was the runaway winner in Horse of the Year, Four-year-old & up male and Male turf (3yo&up). He has won eight straight races ahead of the Woodbine Mile and 13 of his last 15 races overall including the Breeders' Cup in November. This year he looks to be on an Eclipse Award path once again - four starts and four impressive wins. Last time out was the Grade 2 Fourstardave Handicap at Saratoga August 10 after the Grade 3 Firecracker Handicap in June, the Woodford Reserve Turf Classic in May and the Maker's 46 Mile Stakes in April. He is simply the most dominant horse on the planet right now and is the defending champion in this race. Obviously Wise Dan is the favorite in the race - he will have John Velazquez in the saddle from post 4 at overwhelming 2-5 odds. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-woodbine-racetrack-woodbine-mile.html">Read More</a></p>

This after an ugly ninth in the Grade 2 Dixie and a DNF in the Elkhorn. He did place in three straight around this time last year - a win in the Grade 2 Sky Classic, a third in the 2012 version of this race and another third in the Grade 1 Canadian International but he struggled a tad after that before finding his form again in July. Forte Dei Marmi is tough to beat when running well and that is precisely what he is doing right now for trainer Roger Attfield. He should be considered the favorite and breaks from post 5 with John Velazquez in the saddle. <a href="https://www.offtrackbetting.com/horse_betting_news/2013-woodbine-racetrack-northern-dancer-turf-stakes.html">Read More</a></p>
